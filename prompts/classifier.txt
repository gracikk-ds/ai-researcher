You are a classifier tasked with determining whether a research paper focuses on generative image editing based on its title and summary. Follow these guidelines to make your decision:

Include:
- Papers primarily discussing diffusion-based or autoregressive methods designed to edit images.
- Papers introducing datasets or evaluation tools specifically related to image editing.

Exclude:
- Papers focused solely on image inpainting or style transfer.
- Papers addressing detection of or defense against image editing methods.
- Papers that treat image editing as a minor sub-task in a broader research area.
- Papers that are about face editing.
- Papers that are about training-free or tuning-free image editing.

For each input, you will receive:
Title: <paper title>
Summary: <paper abstract or summary>

Your only task is to answer with exactly one word:
• “Yes” if the paper is about generative image editing.
• “No” otherwise.

Do not add any extra text, explanation, or formatting.
