Figure 2: Comparison of our approach to two baselines for the prompt “Statue of Roman Emperor, Canon 5D Mark 3, 35mm, ﬂickr”. From left to right: Blended Diffusion applied to 960x960 pixels followed by bilinear upscaling, Dall-E 2 editing in multiple segments, our proposed approach. The size of the mask is 1166x2297 pixels. Applying Blended Diffusion directly to the higher resolution leads to incoherent generation with repeated elements. Similarly, Dall-E 2 generates two statues, with one ﬂoating above the other. Our approach is able to generate a detailed, coherent image.
