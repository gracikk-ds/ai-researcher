Figure 5: Ablation of different upscaling methods, applied after the Blended Diffusion in the ﬁrst stage with ﬁxed seeds. a) Bilinear upscaling, b) ESRGAN, c) ESRGAN + unconditional diffusion, d) ESRGAN + text-conditional diffusion, e) ESRGAN + text-conditional Blended Diffusion, f) ESRGAN + text-conditional Blended Diffusion with a low-pass ﬁltered background. Note that the images are downscaled from the full resolution.
