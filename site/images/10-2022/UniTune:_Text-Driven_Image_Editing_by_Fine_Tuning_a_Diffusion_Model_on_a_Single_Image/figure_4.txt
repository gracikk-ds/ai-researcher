Fig. 4. Images for the prompt "minion" after fine-tuning on the image on the left, with various degrees of Classifier Free Guidance weights. With standard conditioned sampling (second from the left), the model is biased towards the image it was fine-tuned on. Using Classifier Free Guidance (right) we observe that the knowledge of what a "minion" is, is preserved within the modelâ€™s weights.
