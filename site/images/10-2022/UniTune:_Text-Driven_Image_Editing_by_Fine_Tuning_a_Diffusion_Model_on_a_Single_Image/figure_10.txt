Fig. 10. Comparison of UniTune and Text2LIVE. The original images and Text2LIVE edits are taken from the Text2LIVE paper [Bar-Tal et al . 2022]. We observe comparable results for the types of edits Text2LIVE supports. We have not compared UniTune to Text2LIVE for complex edits, like adding new objects or deviating from the original layout, as Text2LIVE does not support these kinds of edits. To generate UniTune examples we manually selected the best result out of 64 variations generated with different UniTune configurations. The edit prompts for the last two examples were slightly changed from the original paper to mention ’coffee cup’ and ’cigar’.
