Figure 6: Qualitative comparison on Reason50K between ReasonBrain and selected SOTA methods. Compared to other SOTA methods, ReasonBrain demonstrates a strong ability to reason over implicit hypothetical instructions and produce semantically plausible edits grounded in world knowledge. As shown in Fig. 6 , we visualize editing results of ReasonBrain and selected SOTA methods across four different reasoning scenarios. Our method demonstrates superior capability in executing hypothetical editing instructions by accurately reasoning about user intent, affected objects, and their plausible state transitions, while also maintaining stability in non-edited regions. For instance, in the first row (physical reasoning), our method successfully generates a physically plausible and contextually coherent scene–depicting the elephant and mouse standing on opposite ends of a seesaw, where the heavier elephant naturally tilts the seesaw downward. This highlights our model’s ability to reason about relative weight, spatial arrangement, and physical dynamics implied by the instruction. In contrast, InstructPix2Pix fails to capture the core intent, producing an irrelevant result. Other methods may include the correct objects mentioned in the instruction–such as the elephant,
