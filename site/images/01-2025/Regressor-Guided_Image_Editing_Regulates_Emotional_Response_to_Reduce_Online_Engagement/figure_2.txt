Fig. 2. Parametric optimization: To adapt an input image 𝐼 , the parameters 𝑝 of the differentiable image transformations 𝑇 are optimized to produce a similar image that elicits a reduced emotional response, represented by ˆ 𝐼 = 𝑇 ( 𝐼, 𝑝 ) . The optimization minimizes the distance between the predicted valence and arousal of the adapted image, [ ˆ 𝑣, ˆ 𝑎 ] = 𝑅 ( ˆ 𝐼 ) , and the emotional reference , [ 𝑣 ′ ,𝑎 ′ ] . It further ensures a high cosine similarity between the CLIP-space embeddings of the input image 𝑐 = 𝐶𝐿𝐼𝑃 ( 𝐼 ) and the transformed image ˆ 𝑐 = 𝐶𝐿𝐼𝑃 ( ˆ 𝐼 ) .
