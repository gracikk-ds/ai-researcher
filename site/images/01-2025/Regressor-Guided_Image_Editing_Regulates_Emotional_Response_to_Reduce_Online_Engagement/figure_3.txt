Fig. 3. Latent style optimization: To adapt an input image 𝐼 , its latent style vector 𝑠 is optimized to generate a similar image that elicits a reduced emotional response when decoded with 𝐼 ’s latent content 𝑐 0 = 𝐸 𝑐 ( 𝐼 ) , resulting in ˆ 𝐼 = 𝐷 ( 𝑐 0 ,𝑠 ) . The optimization process minimizes the distance between the predicted valence and arousal of the adapted image, [ ˆ 𝑣, ˆ 𝑎 ] = 𝑅 ( ˆ 𝐼 ) , and the target values specified by emotional reference , [ 𝑣 ′ ,𝑎 ′ ] . Additionally, the optimization incorporates a term to ensure content consistency by minimizing the L1 loss between the encoded latent content of the generated image, ˆ 𝑐 = 𝐸 𝑐 ( ˆ 𝐼 ) , and 𝑐 0 . The style vector 𝑠 is initialized as the encoded style vector of the input image, 𝑠 0 = 𝐸 𝑠 ( 𝐼 ) .
