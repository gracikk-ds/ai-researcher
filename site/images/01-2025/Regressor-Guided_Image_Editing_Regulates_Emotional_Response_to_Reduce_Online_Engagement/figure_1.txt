Fig. 1. We propose three regressor-guided image editing approaches aimed at reducing the emotional intensity evoked by images. These methods take the original image (b) as input and modify it using distinct strategies. The first two approaches adjust low-level properties, such as brightness, saturation, color, and sharpness, by optimizing either the style latent space of a generative adversarial network (a) or the parameters of global image transformations (c). The third approach uses score guidance and classifier-free guidance with a diffusion model to modify the image content (d). These semantic changes include adding extra layers of clothing, simplifying backgrounds, or aging the appearance of subjects. Experimental results show that the adapted images produced by the diffusion-model-based approach effectively influence viewersâ€™ emotional responses compared to their original counterparts and, unlike greyscale images, maintain a high perceived image quality.
