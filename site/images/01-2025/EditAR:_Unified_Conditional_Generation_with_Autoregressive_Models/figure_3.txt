Figure 3. Comparison of EditAR (Ours) to feed-forward methods (InstructPix2Pix [ 4 ], MGIE [ 17 ]) and inversion-based approaches (Prompt-to-Prompt [ 22 ], PnPInversion [ 28 ]) on various edits. Our method preserves input details well and has strong text-to-image alignment. In contrast, baseline results exhibit unrealistic visuals, including exaggerated edits or not following instructions, unrealistic modifications, or are unable to localize objects accurately.
