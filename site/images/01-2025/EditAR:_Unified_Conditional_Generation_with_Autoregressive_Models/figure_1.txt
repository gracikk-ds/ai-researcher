Figure 1. We propose EditAR, a unified conditional autoregressive model for diverse conditional generation tasks. We demonstrate that without task-specific designs, a single autoregressive model achieves strong performance across diverse tasks, including texture manipulation, object replacement, object removal, local editing, canny-to-image, depth-to-image, and segmentation-to-image.
