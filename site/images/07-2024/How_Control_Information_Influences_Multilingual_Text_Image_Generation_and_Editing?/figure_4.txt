Figure 4: The pipeline of our TextGen. It comprises two stages: the global control stage and the detail control stage. Control information utilizes a Fourier Enhancement Convolution (FEC) block and a Spatial Convolution (SC) block to extract features. During inference, we introduce a novel denoising paradigm to unify generation and editing based on our framework design. Best shown in color.
