Fig. 1 The proposed Add-SD pipeline begins with the creation of a RemovalDataset containing image pairs via random instance removal. These datasets are then employed to fine-tune image-to-image generation using the Stable Diffusion Model. Next, generation occurs on the entire dataset by sampling rare classes to alleviate the long-tail issue. Finally, synthetic images are integrated into the original dataset to enhance downstream tasks.
