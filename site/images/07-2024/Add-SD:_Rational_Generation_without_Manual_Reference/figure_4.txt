Fig. 4 We design a super-label-based sampling strategy to restrict the category of the added object, ensuring rationality. Then, we randomly sample a sub-label within the super-label, assigning a higher weight to tail-class labels to alleviate the long-tail problem. After image generation, the annotations are inherited from the vanilla dataset (green) for the original instance and grounded (red) for the added instance.
