Figure 2 Overview of SeedEdit3.0 human evaluation. Left Spider Graph of ours vs. other methods on various metrics. Details in Sec. 4 . Right : Speed and usability rate comparison. Dot size represent roughly the model size. We illustrate hypothesized size of GPT4o and Gemini2.0 based on their speed. For SeedEdit, although the model size increases, the pipeline is simplified, so the speed improves as well.
