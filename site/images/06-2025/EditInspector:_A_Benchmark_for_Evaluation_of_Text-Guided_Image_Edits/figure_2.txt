The edit appears to be accurately executed but includes unexpected elements, such as differences in the door layers and a tilted star edge. There are mild artifacts, including a shadow behind the wall and a thick gray line beneath the star cutout. Clicking the tree icons opens decision trees that help annotators follow the evaluation guidelines (See Appendix A.16 ).
