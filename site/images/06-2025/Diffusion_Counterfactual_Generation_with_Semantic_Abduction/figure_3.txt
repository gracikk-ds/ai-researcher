Figure 3. CelebA-HQ ( 64 × 64 ) counterfactuals generated using amortised, anti-causally guided semantic mechanisms. (a) DSCM with spatial ( u ), semantic ( z ) and dynamic ( ∅ ∗ 1: T ) exogenous noise terms for x . (b) shows counterfactual soundness using semantic abduction with p ∅ = 0 . 1 and ω = 2 . (c) shows that semantic mechanisms improve identity preservation, and dynamic abduction further improves backgrounds, hairstyle, skin colour and facial structure. Here, the choice of η is fine-tuned for each observation.
