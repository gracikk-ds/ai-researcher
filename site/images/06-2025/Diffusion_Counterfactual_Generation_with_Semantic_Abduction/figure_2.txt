Figure 2. Morpho-MNIST ( 28 × 28 ) counterfactuals generated using an amortised, anti-causally guided semantic mechanism ( p ∅ = 0 . 1 , ω = 1 . 5 ) based on the DSCM shown in (a). (b) illustrates counterfactual soundness (Obs: Observation, Comp: Composition, Cf: Counterfactual, Rev: Reversibility). (c) depicts image counterfactuals: interventions are shown above the top row and the bottom row visualises total causal effects (red: increase, blue: decrease), refer to (Appendix A.2 ) for details.
