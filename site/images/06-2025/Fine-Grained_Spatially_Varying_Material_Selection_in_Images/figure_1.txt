Fig. 1. Our proposed method allows fine-grained material selection in images on two different levels of granularity, significantly outperforming previous work (Materialistic [Sharma et al . 2023]) in selection accuracy and consistency. We show here results on challenging examples due to specular reflections (top left) and fine patterns outside the training data (top right, bottom left). Selection masks are shown as green image overlays. The bottom right row shows material editing results using our predicted two-level selection masks, with the masks shown as insets.
