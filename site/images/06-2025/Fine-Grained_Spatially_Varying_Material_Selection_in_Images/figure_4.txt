Fig. 4. DuMaS training dataset creation. Starting from twelve base noise patterns from Substance Designer, we vary their parameters to create 1,571 binary masks which we use to randomly combine 3,026 stationary reflectance maps to generate 10,881 materials (see text for more details). We assign these material maps to objects of our 132 scenes under different combinations, and render videos by varying camera viewpoints, resulting in 816,415 individual images. For each image, our dataset includes dense annotations at both subtexture and texture level; annotation IDs are mapped to gray levels for visualization.
