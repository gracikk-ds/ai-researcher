Fig. 6. Qualitative comparison. Texture-level selection results for Materialistic, SAM2 fine-tuned on our DuMaS dataset, and our method. The white squares highlight areas where the methods struggle. Materialistic fails to select relevant areas, especially in the presence of small or thin structures (first and last rows), or to produce sharp, clear selections (second and third rows). SAM2 has improved sharpness, but produces many false positives in areas of similar appearance.
