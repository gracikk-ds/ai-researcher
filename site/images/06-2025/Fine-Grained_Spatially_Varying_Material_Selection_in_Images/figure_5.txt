Fig. 5. Qualitative results . We show results of our method (two-level selection) for images in our real-world test datasets. For each example and level, we show the predicted, binarized selection masks as green image overlays and the similarity score before thresholding in false color (blue low, red high). Our method works well at both subtexture and texture levels even for cluttered scenes and patterns very different from the ones in the training set (third row, wallpaper), and with challenging examples where objects in the scene share the same color (bottom row). In non-spatially varying materials (bottom row) our modelâ€™s predictions for both levels are consistently the same.
