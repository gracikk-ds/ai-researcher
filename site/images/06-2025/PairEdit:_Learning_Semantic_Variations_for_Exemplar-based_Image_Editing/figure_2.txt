Figure 2: Overview of PairEdit. (Left) Given a pair of source and target images, we jointly train two LoRAs: a content LoRA, which reconstructs the source image using the standard diffusion loss (Eq. 3), and a semantic LoRA, which captures the semantic difference between the paired images using the proposed semantic loss (Eq. 10). (Right) During inference, when applying the learned semantic LoRA, the original image is edited towards the target semantic.
