Figure 6: Comparisons on Complex Instructions with Leading Multimodal Models. Our method achieves comparable or even better edit completeness and pre-post consistency. multiple sequential edits. Unlike competing approaches, which frequently omit specified instructions or introduce extraneous alterations unrelated to the editing directives, our framework faithfully executes each instruction while maintaining superior image consistency and instance preservation.
