Figure 4: Qualitative comparisons with several state-of-the-art models on the HarmonyBench dataset. cations. Notably, SEED-X [ 11 ] additionally shows inconsistencies in object count. (3) In style editing (last two rows), IMAGHarmony transfers the target style ( e.g., “Cyberpunk” ) without altering object semantics or disrupting spatial arrangement. In contrast, existing methods frequently over-stylize or distort structure. For example, Show-o [ 61 ] mistakenly changes the object category during editing. In summary, IMAGHarmony effectively disentangles content from instructions, delivering semantically faithful and structurally consistent edits, even under complex multi-object.
