Figure 1 Overview of ByteMorph . a) We first construct ByteMorph-6M and ByteMorph-Bench, a large-scale dataset and a corresponding evaluation benchmark with data that covers a diverse range of non-rigid motions. b) We then fine-tune ByteMorpher, a diffusion transformer model initialized with pretrained weights from Flux.1-dev [ 3 ], using the data collected in ByteMorph-6M. The distribution of ByteMorph-6M is shown in c).
