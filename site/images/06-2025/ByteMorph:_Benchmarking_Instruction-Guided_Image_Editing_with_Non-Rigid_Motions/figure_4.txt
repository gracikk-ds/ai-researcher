Figure 4 Qualitative comparison of ByteMorpher and other methods from the industry on ByteMorph-Bench. GPT-4o-Image and ByteMorpher demonstrate strong instruction-following quality while GPT-4o-Image struggles to preserve the identity and appearance in the source image. On the other hand, Gemini-2.0-flash-image and SeedEdit 1.6 preserve ID well but cannot consistently follow the motion editing instructions.
