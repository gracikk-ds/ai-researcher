Figure 2: Overall Pipeline of BPM . Firstly, LLM is utilized to parse and analyze editing instruction, generates responses to identify the source and target object, as well as the object size and position changing state requirement during editing. Then we conduct Region-Aware Judge to verify editing follows the instruction for region size and position, yielding region-aware score S region . For Semantic-Aware Judge , we utilize detection and segmentation tools to locate and segment the edited object, subsequently apart the origin and edited images into edited regions and irrelevant regions, separately evaluating the semantical instruction compliance in edited regions and content preservation in irrelevant regions, yielding semantic-aware score S semantic .
