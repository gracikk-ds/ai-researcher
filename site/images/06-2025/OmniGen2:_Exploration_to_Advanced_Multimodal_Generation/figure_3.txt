Figure 3: An illustration of Omni-RoPE. It decomposes position information into three components: (1) a Sequence and Modality Identifier ( id seq ) that is constant for all tokens within a single image (treating it as a semantic unit) but unique across different images; and (2) and (3) 2D spatial coordinates ( h, w ) that are locally computed from (0,0) for each image entity. This dual mechanism enables the model to unambiguously distinguish different images via their unique id seq , while the shared local spatial coordinates enhance consistency for tasks like image editing.
