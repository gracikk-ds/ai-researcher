Figure 3: Concept replacement using an image editing technique (SDE DIT ). When the unacceptable concept detector flags a reconstructed image, Gaussian noise is added to the image as part of the SDE DIT mechanism. Concurrently, an editing prompt—tailored to the original input—is encoded through a text encoder. This encoded prompt, coupled with the noisy image, guides the denoising process to produce a final output image free of unacceptable concept.
