Figure 4: Concept replacement with a targeted editing approach. When a face is detected in the reconstructed image, it is isolated from the background, and passed through an unacceptable concept detector. If the detector flags the image, an image-to-mask generator constructs a mask, which is then edited to modify the face. The modified face is then composited back into the background using Poisson blending.
