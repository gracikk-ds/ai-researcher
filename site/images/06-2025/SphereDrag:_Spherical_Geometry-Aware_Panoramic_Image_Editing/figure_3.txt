Figure 3: Overview of SphereDrag. Using DragDiffusion as our baseline, we introduce our three parts: adaptive reprojection (AR), great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA), and spherical search region tracking (SSRT). AR: It applies spherical rotation to transform input panoramic images into a suitable representation. GCTA: It handles the points P tar , P k , and P han using the great-circle distance d gc in a spherical manner. The underlying planar feature maps visualize the corresponding trajectory. SSRT: It highlights the current (blue) and future (red) search regions, which have equal sizes on the sphere. However, their projected areas differ on the feature maps due to spherical distortion.
