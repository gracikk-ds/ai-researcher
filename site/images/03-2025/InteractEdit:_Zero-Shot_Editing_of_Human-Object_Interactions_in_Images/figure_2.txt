Figure 2. Overview of the InteractEdit framework. HOI components are disassembled into subject, object, and background clues during inversion (Sec. 3.3 ). LoRA regularization enables non-rigid edits by capturing essential attributes while ignoring fine-grained structural details (Sec. 3.4 ). Selective fine-tuning preserves interaction priors while adapting to the source imageâ€™s identity (Sec. 3.5 ). Editing reassembles these components with the target interaction, using trained LoRA weights to guide the diffusion model (Sec. 3.6 ).
