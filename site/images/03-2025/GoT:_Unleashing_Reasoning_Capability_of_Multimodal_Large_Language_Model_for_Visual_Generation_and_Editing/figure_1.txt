Figure 1. Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT) with Semantic-Spatial Reasoning. Our approach transforms input prompts into explicit reasoning chains with coordinates (middle), which guides vivid image generation and precise editing (right). This reasoning-based generation paradigm unifies spatial understanding across visual tasks: semantically-grounded visual generation (top), controllable interactive generation (middle), and localized image editing (bottom).
