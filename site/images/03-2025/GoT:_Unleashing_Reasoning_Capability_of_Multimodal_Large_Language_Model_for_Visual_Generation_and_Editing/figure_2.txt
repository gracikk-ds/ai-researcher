Figure 2. GoT Dataset Construction Process. Left: Text-to-image GoT annotation pipeline that labels detailed GoT with semantic content and spatial coordinates. Right: Editing GoT annotation pipeline that processes source image, target image, and instruction to generate entity-aware reasoning GoT with precise spatial grounding. Both pipelines leverage Qwen2-VL [ 46 ] and Qwen2.5 [ 51 ] models for various stages of the annotation process.
