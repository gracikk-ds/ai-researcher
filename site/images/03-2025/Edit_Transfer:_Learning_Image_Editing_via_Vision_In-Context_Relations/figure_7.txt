Figure 7. Influence of dataset scale. (a) Setting the number of training samples per editing type to N c = 2 is sufficient for learning effective non-rigid edits, even when the total number of editing types N T = 10 . (b) Increasing N T = 21 further improves the modelâ€™s ability to capture subtle local edits and enhances its generalization to cases where the editing example and query image are spatially misaligned.
