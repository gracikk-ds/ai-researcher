Figure 2. Comparisons with existing editing paradigms. (a) Existing TIE methods [ 20 – 25 ] rely solely on text prompts to edit images, making them ineffective for complex non-rigid transformations that are difficult to describe accurately. (b) Existing RIE methods [ 6 – 15 ] incorporate visual guidance via a reference image but primarily focus on appearance transfer, failing in non-rigid pose modifications. (c) In contrast, our proposed Edit Transfer learns and applies the transformation observed in editing examples to a query image, effectively handling intricate non-rigid edits.
