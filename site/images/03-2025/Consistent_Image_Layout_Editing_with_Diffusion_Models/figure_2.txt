Figure 2. Semantic consistency in diffusion feature space. The first column shows the original image and the layout editing result by our method, and the following columns show the principal component analysis (PCA) [ 25 ] of intermediate diffusion features. The similar semantics share similar colors. It shows that semantic consistency in the RGB space can be extended into diffusion feature space across the whole denoising process
