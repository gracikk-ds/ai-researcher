Figure 7. Concepts entanglement in synchronous editing. The cross-attention maps and the edited results for synchronous editing, independent editing and asynchronous editing. It shows that editing simultaneously can lead to the entanglement of multiple concepts (in the second column, the cross-attention maps corresponding to ”chair” and ”cat” show high response for ”pot” and ”balloon”), which diminishes the appearance fidelity. Asynchronous editing can alleviate this issue.
