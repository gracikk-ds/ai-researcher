Figure 3. The proposed hybrid visual cross attention module (HVCA, left) and the time-aware target injection module (TATI, right). HVCA exploits hybrid encoders of pre-trained networks to balance between global semantic information (e.g., multi-modal alignment networks like CLIP) and local details. TATI utilizes timestep embeddings to incorporate target information into the denoising process.
