Figure 2. The overall framework of FireEdit. The core of FireEdit is to conduct region-aware fusion of multi-modal tokens to promote VLMs and facilitate fine-grained, localized alignments between editing instructions and images. It also introduces a hybrid visual crossattention module to better preserve image details and a time-aware target injection module to edit targets adaptively.
