Fig. 1. Bokeh Diffusion enables precise, scene-consistent bokeh control in text-to-image diffusion models. Top Left: Images are conditioned on an explicit blur parameter to generate outputs ranging from sharp to strongly defocused. Top Right: Our method maintains consistent scene content across different blur level conditions. Bottom: Continuous adjustment of blur strength produces smooth transitions across the bokeh range.
