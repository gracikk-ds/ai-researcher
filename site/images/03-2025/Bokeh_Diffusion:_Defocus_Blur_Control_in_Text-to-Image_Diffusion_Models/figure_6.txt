Fig. 6. Overview of Bokeh Diffusion’s conditioning and scene-consistency mechanisms. Bokeh Cross-Attention (Sec. 3.3 ), applied at deeper layers of the text-to-image diffusion model, injects a defocus conditioning signal, decoupled from semantic guidance. Grounded Self-Attention (Sec. 3.4 ) ensures fine-grained scene consistency across different defocus levels, where the pivot image’s queries anchor the scene structure, while shared keys allow the model to disentangle defocus blur from scene composition.
