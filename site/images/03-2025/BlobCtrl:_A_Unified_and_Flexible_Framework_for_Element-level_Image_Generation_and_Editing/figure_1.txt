Figure 1: Our proposed BlobCtrl framework enables comprehensive element-level control over both visual appearance and spatial layout, facilitating diverse manipulation operations including compositional generation, spatial transformation, element removal, content replacement and arbitrary combinations thereof (top). Through an iterative refinement process, BlobCtrl allows precise and fine-grained editing capabilities to achieve desired visual outcomes (bottom).
