Figure 3: Overview of BlobCtrl . Our framework consists of: (1) A dual-branch architecture with a foreground branch for element identity encoding and a background branch for scene context preservation and harmonization. Both branches use concatenated inputs of noisy latents and reference conditions (Sec. 3.1 ). (2) A self-supervised training paradigm for element-level manipulation through stochastic position generation and target reconstruction optimization. Through feature fusion between branches, our framework achieves precise control over elements while maintaining visual coherence.
