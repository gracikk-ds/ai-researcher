Figure 4: Visual comparison of element-level manipulation capabilities across different methods. We evaluate five fundamental operations: composition, movement, resizing, replacement and removal. Anydoor ( Chen et al. , 2023 ) struggles with precise identity preservation, GliGen ( Li et al. , 2023 ) fails to maintain any identity information, and Magic Fixup ( Chen et al. , 2023 ) produces results with poor visual harmonization. In contrast, BlobCtrl achieves superior results across all operations while maintaining both identity preservation and visual harmony. We recommend zooming in to examine the source images and element-level manipulation instructions in detail.
