Figure 5. Comparison with state-of-the-art approaches for instruction-guided image editing, including HIVE [ 33 ], Inst-Inpaint (I-Inp) [ 30 ], Watch Your Steps (WYS) [ 16 ], ZONE [ 11 ], MagicBrush (MagBr) [ 32 ], InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) [ 1 ] showcasing the strength of our approach. CLIP-T value of each output is shown at its top-left corner, with the best value per row underlined. Note that the image with the best CLIPT score is not necessarily the visually best result, underscoring the deficiencies of conventional metrics (including CLIP-I and DINO-I shown in the supplemental) for measuring the quality of image edits.
