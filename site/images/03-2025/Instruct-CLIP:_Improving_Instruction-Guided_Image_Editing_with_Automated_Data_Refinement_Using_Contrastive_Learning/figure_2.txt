Figure 2. Problems with existing instruction-guided imageediting datasets [ 1 ]. As shown, there are many examples where the datasetâ€™s original edit instruction does not match the actual changes in the images. Our I-CLIP approach refines edit instructions to match the visual change better and allows us to train a system that produces better outputs. The values in parentheses are the cosine similarity between the visual change from the original to the edited image and the edit instruction from I-CLIP.
