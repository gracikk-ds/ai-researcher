Figure 2: (L) We utilize ControlNet by using the same input image as the conditional image, and concatenating the prompt with the editing instruction as the textual control. (R) We compare ControlNet with InstructPix2Pix and also ablate the necessity of concatenating the prompt with the editing instructions, which are generated by ChatGPT-4o. (Top) : The prompt is “Italian coastline, buildings, ocean, architecture, surrealism by Michiel Schrijver.” The editing instruction is “Incorporate iconic Italian elements like olive trees or Vespa scooters. Enhance the coastline with more distinct Mediterranean features. Add intricate architectural details typical of Italian structures. Intensify the ocean’s depth with gradient blues, and ensure the surrealism reflects Michiel Schrijver’s style by blending dreamlike elements.” In this case, InstructPix2Pix struggles to make any fine-grained modifications. (Bottom) : The prompt is “Mickey Mouse in a Superman outfit bodybuilding.” The editing instruction is “Adjust the character to have Mickey Mouse’s face, including distinct ears, in a Superman outfit. Include bodybuilding elements such as visible muscles or weights. Ensure the outfit is accurate with the Superman logo prominently displayed.” In this case, InstructPix2Pix distorts the image. In both cases, adding the image prompt to the editing instruction for the final instruction yields better results in terms of following the instructions while keeping most of the original image unchanged.
