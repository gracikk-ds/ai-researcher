Figure 4. The proposed Editing Pipeline. Given the source image I s and prompt pair { P s , P t } , we obtain the target noise Z t K through inversion process (up row). PSL works on the first inversion step incorporated with a blended word provided by diff ( P s , P t ) . In the sample process (down row), we guide the editing through Feature-level control and Latent-level control, which receive the M generated by PSL and the binary mask M Î» respectively. Notably Feature-level control only works on last r layers.
