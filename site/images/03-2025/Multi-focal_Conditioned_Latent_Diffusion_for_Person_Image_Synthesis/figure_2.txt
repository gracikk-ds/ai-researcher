Figure 2. The overall pipeline of our proposed Multi-focal Conditioned Diffusion Model. (a) Face regions and appearance regions are first extracted from the source person images; (b) multi-focal condition aggregation module Ï• is used to fuse the focal embeddings as c emb ; (c) ReferenceNet R is used to aggregate information from the appearance texture map, denoted as c ref ; (d) Densepose provides the pose control to be fused into UNet with noise by Pose Guider.
