Figure 1. (a) The VAE [ 38 ] reconstruction deteriorates the detailed information of person images, especially the facial regions and complex textures. These issues worsen for the generated latent with small deviations. A small deviation Ïµ = 0 . 2 is added to demonstrate the often case of generated latent. (b) Our methods preserve this detailed information better than other LDM-based methods by introducing multi-focal conditions.
