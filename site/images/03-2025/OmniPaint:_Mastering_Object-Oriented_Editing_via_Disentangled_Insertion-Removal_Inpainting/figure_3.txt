Figure 3. Illustration of the proposed CFD metric for evaluating object removal quality. Left: We apply SAM to segment the inpainted image into object masks and classify them into nested ( Ω M n ) and overlapping ( Ω M o ) masks. Middle: The context coherence term measures the feature deviation between the inpainted region ( Ω M ) and its surrounding background ( Ω B \ M ) in the DINOv2 feature space. Right: The hallucination penalty is computed by comparing deep features of detected nested objects ( Ω M n ) with their adjacent overlapping masks ( Ω M o ) to assess whether unwanted object-like structures have emerged.
