Figure 2. Visualization of CFD metric assessment for object removal. The segmentation results are obtained using SAM [ 17 ] with refinement, with purple masks for background, orange masks for segments fully within the original mask, and unmasked for those extending beyond the original mask. Note that the orange masked regions correspond to hallucinated objects. A higher ReMOVE [ 4 ] score is better, while a lower CFD score is preferable. In these cases, ReMOVE scores are too similar to indicate removal success, while CFD score offers a clearer distinction.
