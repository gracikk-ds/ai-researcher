Realistic Object Removal Generative Object Insertion Figure 1. Illustration of OmniPaint for object-oriented editing, including realistic object removal (left) and generative object insertion (right). Masked regions are shown as semi-transparent overlays. In removal cases, the Ã— marks the target object and its physical effects, such as reflections, with the right column showing the results. In insertion cases, the reference object (inset) is placed into the scene, indicated by a green arrow. Note that for model input, masked regions are fully removed rather than semi-transparent.
