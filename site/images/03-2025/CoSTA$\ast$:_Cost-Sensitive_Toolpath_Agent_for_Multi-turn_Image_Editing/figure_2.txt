Figure 2. Comparison of CoSTA ∗ with State-of-the-Art image editing models/agents, which include GenArtist ( Wang et al. , 2024b ), MagicBrush ( Zhang et al. , 2024a ), InstructPix2Pix ( Brooks et al. , 2023 ), and CLOVA ( Gao et al. , 2024 ). The input images and prompts are shown on the left of the figure. The outputs generated by each method illustrate differences in accuracy, visual coherence, and the ability to multimodal tasks. Figure 9 shows examples of step-by-step editing using CoSTA ∗ with intermediate subtask outputs presented.
