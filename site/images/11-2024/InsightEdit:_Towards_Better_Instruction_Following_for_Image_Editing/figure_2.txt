Figure 2. The overall data construction pipeline. (1) Captioning & Object Extraction: Utilizing VLM to generate a global caption from the source image, and further get an object JSON list contains both simple caption and detailed caption. (2) Mask Generation: Utilizing GroundedSAM to obtain the corresponding mask of each object. (3) Editing Pair Construction: Utilizing mask-based image editing model to construct target image and templated instruction. (4) Instruction Recaptioning: Utilizing VLM to rewrite instruction to gain diverse instructions. (5) Quality Evaluation: Filtering the datasets using VIEScore.
