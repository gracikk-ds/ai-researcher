Figure 3. Object removal comparison with mask-based methods. Our model, using tight input masks, generates more visually plausible results with fewer artifacts compared to ControlNet Inpainting [ 50 ], SD-XL Inpainting [ 33 ], and PowerPaint [ 55 ], which all require loose mask input. Besides, our model delivers coherent foreground layers and supports more advanced downstream editing tasks.
