Figure 2. The framework of L AYER D ECOMP . The model takes four inputs: two conditional inputs, including a composite image and an object mask, and two noisy latent representations of the background and foreground layers. During training, we use simulated image triplets alongside camera-captured background-composite image pairs. We also introduce a pixel-space consistency loss to ensure that natural visual effects such as shadows and refelctions are faithfully preserved in the transparent foreground layer.
