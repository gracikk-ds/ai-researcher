Figure 4. Overview of LoRA of Change (LoC) framework. (a) shows that the hypernetwork H generates the instruction-specific LoRA with the before-after image pair < A, A ′ > as inputs. (b) presents the LoRA reverse training. With the generated LoRA ∆ , the red arrows → indicate that the model is trained to reconstruct B ′ taking B as spatial condition while the blue arrows → indicate that the model is trained to reconstruct B taking B ′ as spatial condition. (c) is the inference for image editing. L is the image reconstruction loss.
