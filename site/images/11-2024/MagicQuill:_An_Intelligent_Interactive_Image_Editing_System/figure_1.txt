Figure 1. MagicQuill is an intelligent and interactive image editing system built upon diffusion models. Users seamlessly edit images using three intuitive brushstrokes: add, subtract, and color (A). A MLLM dynamically predicts user intentions from their brush strokes and suggests contextual prompts (B1-B4). The examples demonstrate diverse editing operations: to generate a jacket from clothing contour (B1), add a flower crown from head sketches (B2), remove background (B3), and apply color changes to the hair and flowers (B4).
