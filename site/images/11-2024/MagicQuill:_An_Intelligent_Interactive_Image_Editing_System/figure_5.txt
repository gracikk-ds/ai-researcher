Figure 5. Illustration of dataset construction process. (a) Original images from the DCI dataset; (b) Edge maps extracted from original images; (c) Selected masks (highlighted in purple) with highest edge density; (d) Results after BrushNet inpainting on augmented masked regions; (e) Final results with edge map overlay on selected areas. By overlaying edge maps on inpainted results, we simulate scenarios where users edit images with brush strokes, as the edge maps resemble hand-drawn sketches. The bounding box coordinates of the mask and labels are inherited from the DCI dataset.
