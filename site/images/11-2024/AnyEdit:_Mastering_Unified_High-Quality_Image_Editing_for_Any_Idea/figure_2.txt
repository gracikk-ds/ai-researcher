Figure 2. The comprehensive construction pipeline of AnyEdit. We summarize the general pipeline into five steps: (1) General data preparation from real-world image-text pairs and synthetic scenes. (2) Diverse instruction generation using LLM to produce high-quality editing instructions. (3) Pre-filtering for instruction validation. (4) Adaptive editing pipeline tailors specific editing methods for each edit type to generate high-quality edited images. (5) Image quality assessment ensures high-quality editing pairs for the AnyEdit Dataset.
