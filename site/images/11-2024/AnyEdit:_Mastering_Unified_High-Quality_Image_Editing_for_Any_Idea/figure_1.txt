Figure 1. Examples of AnyEdit at scale. We comprehensively categorize image editing tasks into 5 groups based on different editing capabilities: (a) Local Editing which focuses on region-based editing ( green area ); (b) Global Editing which focuses on the full range of image rendering ( yellow area ); (c) Camera Move Editing which focuses on viewpoints changing instead of scenes ( gray area ); (d) Implicit Editing which requires commonsense knowledge to complete complex editing ( orange area ); (e) Visual Editing which encompasses additional visual inputs, addressing the requirements for multi-modal editing ( blue area ).
