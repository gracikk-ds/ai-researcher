Figure 2: Overview of the O MNI -E DIT training pipeline. The pipeline consists of four stages: (1) task-specific specialist models are trained for diverse editing tasks; (2) these specialist models are used to generate a large, high-resolution, multi-aspect-ratio dataset; (3) a cost-efficient distilled large multi-modal model (LMM) assigns importance weights to each pair of image-editing data; and (4) the final generalist model is trained on the weighted dataset.
