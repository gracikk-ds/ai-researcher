Figure 2. Illustration of our proposed IID framework. T denotes the total number of diffusion steps, while S represents the pre-defined step for mask generation and multi-instruction influence disentanglement. ¯ z S [ M i ] corresponds to the token sequence of the noised image ¯ z S associated with the mask M i for the instruction P i (ideally representing the tokens pertinent to the editing area specified by P i ).
