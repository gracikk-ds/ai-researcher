Figure 3: Architecture of ILLUME+. (a) The dual vision tokenizer preserves both semantic and texture information. (b) The diffusion refiner decodes discrete tokens into high-quality images. (c) The unified MLLM enables deep semantic interactions and context-aware image generation. (d) We introduce an unambiguous image representation of discrete tokens in a chain-of-thought pattern (semantic tokens first, followed by pixel tokens), resulting in improved generation performance.
