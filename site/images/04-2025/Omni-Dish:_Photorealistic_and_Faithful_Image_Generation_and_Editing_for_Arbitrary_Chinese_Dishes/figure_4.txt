Figure 4: Overview of our method. In the yellow block, (a) with the dish curation and recaption, the coarse-to-fine strategy is applied to train Omni-Dish; (b) high-quality captions are obtained from a pre-constructed library and rewritten by large language models for inference. In the green block, (c) the Concept-Enhanced P2P approach is introduced to build the dish editing dataset; (d) a dish editing model is trained through a multi-task data mixture.
