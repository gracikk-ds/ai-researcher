Figure 3. Dataset Generation Pipeline. Our dataset generation pipeline introduces key augmentations such as random positioning, rotation, and grounding of objects within the scene using the 3D-Positioner. Additionally, we pair objects in semantically consistent combinations to simulate complex spatial relationships and occlusions, capturing realistic interactions for multi-object scenes.
