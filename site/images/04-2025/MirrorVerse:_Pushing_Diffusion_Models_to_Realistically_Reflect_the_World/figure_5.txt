Figure 5. Comparison on GSO [ 13 ] dataset. In (a), the baseline method misrepresents object structure, while our method preserves spatial integrity and produces realistic reflections. In (b), the baseline yields incomplete and distorted reflections of the mug, whereas our approach generates accurate geometry, color, and detail, showing superior performance on out-of-distribution objects.
