Figure 6. Results on MirrorBenchV2. We compare our method with the baseline MirrorFusion [ 12 ] on MirrorBenchV2. The baseline method shown struggles with pose variations, even in single-object scenes, and fails to produce accurate reflections for multiple objects. In contrast, our method handles variations in the object orientation effectively and generates geometrically accurate reflections, even in complex, multi-object scenarios.
