Fig. 1. We propose PRISM, a unified framework for conditional generation of RGB image and its intrinsic channels (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. It supports a variety of tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. PRISM achieves plausible results on both local material editing on masked region and global image relighting through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts.
