Fig. 6. Relighting with text prompt. Starting from an input RGB image, intrinsic layers are predicted using PRISM. We then apply PRISM with a text prompt describing a new light condition together with all predicted intrinsic layers except irradiance map. Our relit results preserve the geometric and material properties of the original scenes while achieving plausible appearance under desired lighting conditions.
