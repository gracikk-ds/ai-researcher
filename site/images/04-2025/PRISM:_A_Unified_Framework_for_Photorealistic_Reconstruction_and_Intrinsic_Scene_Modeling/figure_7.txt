Fig. 7. Material editing. PRISM allows text conditioned material editing for a masked region of the input image. While keeping the predicted depth and irradiance fixed, albedo and normal channels are only conditioned outside the mask to allow the changes in the selected region conditioned by text prompt. Our results preserve the identity outside the mask while updating the appearance inside the mask with consistent lighting.
