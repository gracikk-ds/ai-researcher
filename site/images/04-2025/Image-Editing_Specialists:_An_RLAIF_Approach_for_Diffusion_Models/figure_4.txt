Figure 4. Visualization of the impact of the visual prompt (displayed in dashed lines contour) on generated samples when provided the text instruction “add snow on the road”. Our method effectively captures semantic nuances beyond that described in the text prompt. We present further applications of such nuanced control for materials in Fig. 10 , demonstrating how our method can effectively handle diverse visual styles and attributes, such as varying colors, while maintaining structural coherence.
