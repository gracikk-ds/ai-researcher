Fig. 1. POEM. Existing text-based instruction editing methods (top) struggle with precise object-level shape and layout edits. Image interaction-based approaches (middle) perform better but require significant manual user effort. Instead, we propose (bottom) leveraging MLLMs to interpret instructional prompts and automatically generate precise object masks and numerical transformations to support image editing pipelines.
