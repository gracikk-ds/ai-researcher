Fig. 5. Qualitative results. We compare POEM with state-of-the-art image editing models across a diverse set of edit instructions, including geometric transformations (e.g., translation, scaling), appearance changes, and combinations of both. The specific prompts used are “Scale the bus by 0.56" , “Move the pear left by 150px and make it red" , “Scale the mug only vertically to 200px" , “Make the sword gold" , “Scale the orange by 2 and move it left by 150px" , and “Move the ball left by 90px and make it blue" .
