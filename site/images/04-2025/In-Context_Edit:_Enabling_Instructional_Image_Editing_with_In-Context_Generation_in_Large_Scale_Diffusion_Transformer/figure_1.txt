Figure 1. We present In-Context Edit, a novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art instruction-based editing using just 0.5% of the training data and 1% of the parameters required by prior SOTA methods. The first row illustrates a series of multi-turn edits, executed with high precision, while the second and third rows highlight diverse, visually impressive single-turn editing results from our method.
