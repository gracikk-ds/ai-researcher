Figure 2: We present a simple yet effective pipeline for constructing high-quality object-level indoor omnidirectional image editing dataset. Our pipeline is mainly consisted of two parts, i.e. , image pair generation and instruction refinement. (a) The ODI input undergoes viewport splitting to generate six perspective images. (b) Viewport image is processed through a segmentation model for instance-level segmentation and class labeling, followed by dual-stage filtering for quality control. (c) A selected instance is removed via inpainting [ 28 ]. (d) The edited viewport image is seamlessly stitched with other perspective images to form edited ODI. (e) InternVL2-5 [ 9 ] is deployed to refine editing instructions, adding positional details and enhancing linguistic diversity.
