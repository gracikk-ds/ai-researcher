Figure 4: Examples of types of edit sessions made possible with REED-VAE. Using the Vanilla-VAE (right), significant noise and artifacts accumulate quickly after multiple edit operations. Intermediate edit operations are omitted to highlight the final edited image. Four types of edit operations are performed: text-guided editing [ BHE23 ], external editing (not diffusion-based), mask-guided editing [ AFL23 ], and example-guided editing [ YGZ âˆ— 23 ].
