Figure 2: Even without a diffusion model in the pipeline, the Vanilla-VAE (top row) accumulates artifacts and exhibits significant distortion very quickly throughout encode-decode iterations. The tigerâ€™s features lose their distinct shapes and edges, appearing more globular and less defined. The color palette is altered, with a noticeable increase in blue tones and a decrease in the richness of the orange and greens. Fine details such as the grass and the fur are largely lost or blurred. REED-VAE (bottom row), produces successive images that are robust to such artifacts and distortions. The tiger retains its shape, color, and surface details, demonstrating remarkably high fidelity to the original image. The subtle variations in orange and white hues are preserved, and fine elements remain visible.
