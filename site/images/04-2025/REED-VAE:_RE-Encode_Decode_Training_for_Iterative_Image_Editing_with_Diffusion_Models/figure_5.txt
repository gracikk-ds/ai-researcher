Figure 5: Row 1: Null-Text Inversion (NTI) is used to iteratively invert the image and regenerate it from the inverted latent. Row 2: the VanillaVAE is used to iteratively encode and decode the image. Row 3: NTI is used with REED-VAE to iteratively invert the image and regenerate it from the inverted latent. Vanilla NTI loses fidelity to the original image and is not resilient to iterative degradation. Full sequences for Vanilla NTI and NTI + REED are available in the Supplementary Material.
