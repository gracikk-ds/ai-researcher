Figure 1: REED-VAE (top) preserves image quality over multiple editing iterations, allowing users to perform multiple edit operations using a combination of frameworks and techniques. The Vanilla VAE (bottom) accumulates many artifacts and noise along the way, becoming very apparent once multiple iterative edit operations are performed. The total edit sequence consists of 14 steps, of which only the last 4 are shown here for brevity and to highlight the differences in the final picture. Four types of edit operations are performed: text-guided editing [ BHE23 ], external editing (not diffusion-based), mask-guided editing [ AFL23 ], and example-guided editing [ YGZ âˆ— 23 ].
