Figure 3: Given an input image (a) we perform 20 encode-decode iterations and present the the results in image (top) and frequency domain (bottom). Vanilla-VAE (b) exhibits significant loss of highfrequency information (evidenced by the dimming and blurring of the outer regions of the spectrum), and dominance of low-frequency features (evidenced by the enlarged central bright region). In addition, it also introduced new high-frequency features that are not seen in the input image, indicating an introduction of repetitive artifacts. Trying to apply smoothing after each encode-decode iteration (c) solves some of these problems at the cost of blurring the image. REED-VAE (d) demonstrates superior performance in preserving image fidelity across all frequency bands.
