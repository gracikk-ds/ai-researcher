Figure 7. Ablation Study. We perform comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the design choices of CREA: (a) Model Generalization: Our method extends effectively to different generative models, such as SDXL and DALL-E. (b) Parameter Sensitivity: We ablate CFG values for Flux and the conditioning scale for ControlNet to evaluate their impact. (c) Iterative Refinement: We demonstrate the benefits of our method’s refinement process over multiple iterations. (d) Prompt Variations: We explore alternative prompts beyond ‘a creative <obj> ’. For additional ablation results, please refer to Table 3 .
