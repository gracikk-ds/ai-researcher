Figure 1. We introduce CREA, an agentic framework that emulates the human creative process for creative image editing and generation. Our approach is driven by collaborative interactions between specialized agents, such as a Creative Director and an Art Critic , who communicate to refine and enhance creative output. Moreover, our approach can be extended to video domain for creative video generation. Our framework can also be integrated with personalization techniques to further enrich and expand creative workflows.
