Figure 2: Overview of proposed framework (a) and LoRA tuning process (b). (a) We decouple the task of occluded object movement into de-occlusion and movement, handled by parallel branches. Both branches are built upon Stable Diffusion V1.5 and operate simultaneously. The de-occlusion branch leverages the prior knowledge within the diffusion models to complete the occluded portion, while the movement branch mainly places the completed object at the target position. (b) To ensure the content generated by the de-occlusion branch aligns with the characteristics of the target object, we equip this branch with LoRA, which is fine-tuned using a masked diffusion loss that applies exclusively to the visible portions of the object.
