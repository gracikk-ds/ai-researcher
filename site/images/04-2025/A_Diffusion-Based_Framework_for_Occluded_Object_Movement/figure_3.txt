Figure 3: (a)-(b) showcase process of obtaining ¯ I s as Equ. (4). (b) marks 1 − ¯ M v with white mask. (c) (f) are results from variants of De-occlusion Branch. (c) is generated by filling 1 − ¯ M v with noise as Equ. (5). (d) introduces color-fill strategy as Equ. (6). (e) is generated under the guidance of progressively updating masks. (f) is the full Deocclusion Branch. (g) showcases the progressively updating masks based on the refined cross-attention map ¯ R C t .
