Figure 1. Demonstrations of the proposed pipeline. Left : The proposed pipeline takes a text prompt and an expected layout, represented by a bounding box, as input and generates sketches progressively, from rough to detailed. If the results are unsatisfactory, the user can make timely edits during the rough stage at a low cost. Right : one application is layer-based composition, where the layers (i.e., instance masks) and the sketches are both the output from the proposed pipeline.
