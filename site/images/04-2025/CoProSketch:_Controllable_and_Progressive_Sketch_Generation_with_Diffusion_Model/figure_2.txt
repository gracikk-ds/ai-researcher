Figure 2. (a) : The proposed pipeline begins by taking a text prompt and a rough mask (derived from a bounding box) as input to generate a rough UDF representation. If users find the results unsatisfactory, they have the option to edit the rough result. The rough result, which is the sketch decoded from the UDF, is re-encoded back into the UDF after editing. The edited result is then converted into a instance mask, which is fed back into the same model, guided by a different stage indicator, to produce the refined output. (b) : Details of our modified U-Net: The conditional mask is concatenated with the noisy latent. The stage indicator is first converted into an embedding and then added to the time embedding. All other components remain unchanged.
