Figure 3: Overview of Marmot. (a) We first extract descriptions and spatial relationships of scene objects and dynamically adjust the number of objects to achieve counting self-correcting. (b) Subsequently, we perform independent segmentation of each object and utilize a multi-agent self-correcting system to conduct fine-grained editing of each object. (c) Simultaneously, spatially correlated object pairs undergo layout rectification via a parallelized multi-agent self-correcting system. (d) Ultimately, our PDSS seamlessly integrates three-dimensional editing results, while the SDXL-Refiner [26] coupled with composite mask enhances object details and smooth edges.
