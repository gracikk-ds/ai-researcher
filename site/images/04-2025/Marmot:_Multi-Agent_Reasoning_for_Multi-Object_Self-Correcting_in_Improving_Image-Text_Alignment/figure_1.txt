Figure 1: Existing diffusion-based models often struggle with image-text inconsistencies in object counting, attributes, and spatial relationships during the generation process. Our Marmot can seamlessly integrate with text-to-image models to facilitate object-level self-correction, ensuring precise alignment with user descriptions in object counting, attributes, and spatial relationships.
