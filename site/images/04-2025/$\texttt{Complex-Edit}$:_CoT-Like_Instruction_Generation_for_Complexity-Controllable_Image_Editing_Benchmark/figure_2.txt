Figure 2. An overview of our data collection pipeline. The pipeline consists of three distinct stages: 1) Stage #1 Sequence Generation : for each image, a series of atomic instructions is produced; 2) Stage #2 Simplification : each fundamental instruction is refined to eliminate extraneous details, preserving only the essential description of the editing process; 3) Stage #3 Instruction Compounding : several atomic instructions are integrated into one comprehensive instruction.
