Figure 4: Qualitative comparisons of SmartFreeEdit on Reaon-Edit with previous instruction-based image editing methods including InstructPix2Pix (IP2P), InstructDiffusion(IDiff), MagicBrush, BrushEdit, SmartEdit(13B) and latest Gemini 2.0 Flash. Mask-free methods donâ€™t require additional mask input, where we take these methods with same instructions as baselines for comparison and our approach demonstrates superior editing capabilities in complex scenarios.
