Figure 2: Architecture Overview of SmartFreeEdit for Reasoning Complex Scenarios Instruction-Based Editing. Our SmartFreeEdit consists of three key components: 1) An MLLM-driven Promptist that decomposes instructions into Editing Objects, Category, and Target Prompt. 2) Reasoning segmentation converts the prompt into an inference query and generates reasoning masks. 3) An Inpainting-based Image Editor using the hypergraph computation module to enhance global image structure understanding for more accurate edits.
