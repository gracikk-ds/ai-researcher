Figure 5: Comparison across models on three evaluation sub-dimensions. GPT-4o-Image demonstrates superior performance, achieving the highest scores across all three evaluation metrics. Gemini2-Flash-Series also exhibits competitive performance on these criteria. In contrast, the performance of many other evaluated models was considerably lower, indicating significant limitations in their ability to follow instructions and maintain visual integrity.
