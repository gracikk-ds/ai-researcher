Fig. 3. The BE-Cycle’s forward path and inverted path’s masks, outputs, and final edited results. Specifically, the mask is generated by comparing the input and output of the forward or inverted path. To remove the effect of random noise in the mask computing process, we averaged all the masks generated with different hyperparameter combinations. From the comparisons, we can obtain an ice-cream similar to the source image with the unbiased mask.
