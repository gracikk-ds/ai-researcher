Fig. 2. The masks and edited samples generated by our proposed method. The first two rows show comparisons with two most representative baseline models: SDEdit [13], DiffEdit [23], and CycleDiffusion [7]. Among all samples, our method outperforms the other models in image content preservation. Yellow boxes mark unexpected modifications, and the masks reveal the specific edited areas. The last row shows more results generated by the proposed method.
