Fig. 1. The overview of the proposed Dual-cycle Diffusion framework for the semantic image editing task. The pipeline and details of the Bias Elimination Cycle (BE-Cycle) and mask-guided unbiased editing are shown on the left. The modifications on cat ears , caused by the contextual prior bias derived from the pre-trained model , are illustrated in the left-top corner of the images. Given a source image, a source text, and a target text, we first leverage BE-Cycle to produce an unbiased mask, which is then used to guide image editing. On the right, the details of the Structural Consistency Cycle (SCCycle) [7] and the procedure of mask computing are shown. âŠ™ is the elementwise product.
