Figure 2. IIR-Net Overview. Our model mainly consists of two modules: (A) Conditional Latent Diffusion Model: We introduce the original image x as additional control to our model to preserve the text-irrelevant features of x . See Section 3.1 for detailed discussion; (B) Image Information Removal Module: We erase the image information mainly by two operations. First, we convert RGB values to the gray values in the RoI to exclude the color information. Second, we add Gaussian noise to the input image to partially erase the texture-related information. This module is applied to address the identical mapping issue. See Section 3.2 for detailed discussion.
