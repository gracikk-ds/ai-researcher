Figure 5: Examples of how BLIP2 improves the quality of edited images by improving the generated prompts. The three generated prompts are segmentation prompt , input caption and edited caption , respectively. For the first example the BLIP2 description of the image is “Photo of a dog and a cat”. We show three examples for w./wo. BLIP2 with increasing encoding ratio r from left to right. In the second example the BLIP2 description is “Painting of a girl with a pearl earring by Jan Van Gogh”. (BLIP2 gets the name of the painting correct but the name of the artist wrong.)
