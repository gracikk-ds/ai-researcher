Figure 2. Our Custom-Edit consists of two processes: the customization process and the editing process. (a) Customization. We customize a diffusion model by optimizing only language-relevant parameters (i.e., custom embedding V* and attention weights) on a given set of reference images. We also apply the prior preservation loss to alleviate the language drift. (b) Editing. We then transform the source image to the output using the customized word. We leverage the P2P and Null-text inversion methods [ 7 , 16 ] for this process.
