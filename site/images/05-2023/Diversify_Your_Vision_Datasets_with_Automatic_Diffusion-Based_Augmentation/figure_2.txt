Figure 2: ALIA. Given a specialized dataset, we caption all images in our dataset using a pretrained captioning model, and feed these captions into a large language model to summarize them into a small (<10) set of natural language descriptions. Utilizing these descriptions, we perform text-guided image augmentation via a pretrained text-to-image model, thereby generating training images that align with the described settings. Finally, we apply two filtering techniques: a CLIP-based semantic filter to eliminate obvious edit failures, and a confidence-based filter that removes more subtle failures by filtering edits confidently predicted by a classifier trained on the original dataset.
