Figure 4: iWildCam Subset. Left plot visualizes the original training images and the corresponding data generated from ALIA based on the generated prompts. Right plot shows accuracy for adding in generated data from ALIA and baselines as in Section 4.2. ALIA significantly outperforms all the baselines including adding in real data from the test distribution, while +Txt2Img and +RandAug see smaller improvements.
