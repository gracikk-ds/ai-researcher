Figure 3: Filtering. Semantic filtering eliminates instances of total failure (left), but often misses instances of minimal edits (center) or edits which corrupt class information (right). Meanwhile, our confidence-based filtering mechanism is able to remove these failures by leveraging the prediction confidence of classifier trained on the original dataset applied to the image edits.
