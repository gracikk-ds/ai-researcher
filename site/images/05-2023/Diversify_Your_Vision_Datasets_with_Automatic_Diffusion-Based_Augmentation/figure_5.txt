Figure 5: Bird Classification (CUB). Left plot visualizes the original training images and the corresponding data generated from ALIA based on the generated prompts. Right plot shows accuracy for ALIA and baselines. ALIA outperforms all the baselines aside from RandAug and adding in real data, while adding text-to-image generated data results in similar performance with the baseline.
