Figure 6: Waterbirds Results. Left plot shows class-balanced accuracy for ALIA and baselines. Right plot shows the breakdown of in-domain (waterbirds on water, landbirds on land) and outof-domain performance (waterbirds on land, landbirds on water). ALIA is able to roughly match in-domain accuracy of the other methods while drastically improving out-of-domain accuracy of all other augmentation methods. This results in 7% improvement for class-balanced accuracy when compared to other augmentation baselines.
