Figure 2: Overview structure of FISEdit. When a query arrives, our system first executes k denoise steps, and then generates a difference mask according to the output latents of k steps. In the remaining denoise steps, the pre-computed results (activations and parameters) of each layers in U-Net will be reused according to the mask and the feature maps will be computed sparsely. Compared to existing frameworks which leverage the batched inputs, we collect and cache the results of previous generation to avoid redundant computation, and use the mask to control as well as accelerate the new T2I generation process at U-Net level.
