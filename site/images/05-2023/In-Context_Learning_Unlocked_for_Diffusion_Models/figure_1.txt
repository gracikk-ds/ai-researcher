Figure 1: Illustration of the in-context learning ability enabled by our proposed Prompt Diffusion for conditioned image generation tasks: With a prompt consisting of a task-specific example pair of images and text guidance , given a new query image that aligns in type with the source image in the example pair, Prompt Diffusion can comprehend the desired task and generate the corresponding output image on both seen (trained) and unseen (new) task types.
