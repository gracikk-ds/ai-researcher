Figure 7: Image Editing Results. We demonstrate that Prompt Diffusion excels in image editing tasks through two strategies: one-step and two-step. One-step: when only the image condition, e.g. , depth/seg/hed maps, is given, our model would edit the condition for generation according to the text descriptions. Two-Step: when the original image is given, we first do forward sampling to sample image conditions and then conduct inverse tasks to edit the condition with text guidance. Two-Step provides more controllable editing.
