Fig. 2: Our method consists of three steps: (1)Expansion: Massively generating image descriptions and edit instructions based on seed samples using GPT-4. (2)Generation: Generating diptychs using GPT-4V and DALL-E according to image descriptions and instructions. (3)Post-Processing: Post-process diptychs and edit instructions with GPT-4V and other various methods to produce image pairs and further enhance the quality of the dataset in different aspects.
