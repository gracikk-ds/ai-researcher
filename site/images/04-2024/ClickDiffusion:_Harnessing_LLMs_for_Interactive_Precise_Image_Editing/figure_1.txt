Figure 1. C LICK D IFFUSION is an interactive system that enables users to perform fine-grained image manipulation tasks by seamlessly combining natural language and visual prompts. (A) In our example, a user can use our user interface to select a particular dog with a bounding box and a destination using a star. These locations can be referenced symbolically in a natural language instruction. (B) By serializing the original imageâ€™s layout and the multi-modal instruction we can leverage an LLM to produce an edited image layout. (C) The edited layout is then fed into a layout-based image generation system to generate an edited image. (D) Our method enables moving objects and allows for much more concise prompts than text-only editing systems like I NSTRUCT P IX 2P IX [ 3 ].
