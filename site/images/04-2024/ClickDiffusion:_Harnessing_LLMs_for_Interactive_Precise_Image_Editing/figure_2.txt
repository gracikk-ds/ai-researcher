Figure 2. C LICK D IFFUSION enables users to perform precise image manipulations that are difficult to do with text alone. A user can leverage familiar direct manipulation to specify regions or objects in an image, which can be referred to in text instructions. By combining direct manipulation and natural language based editing it becomes much easier for users to perform precise edits like: moving a particular object, adding an object in a specified location, or changing the appearance of an object.
