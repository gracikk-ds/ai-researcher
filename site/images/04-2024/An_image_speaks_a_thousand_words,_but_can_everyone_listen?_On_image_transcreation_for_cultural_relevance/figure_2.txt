Figure 2: Pipelines to transcreate images: e2e-instruct takes as input the original image and a natural language instruction; cap-edit first captions the image, uses a LLM to edit the caption for cultural relevance, and edits the original image using the LLM-edit as instruction; and cap-retrieve uses this LLM-edit to retrieve a natural image from a country-specific image dataset. Given the unprecedented nature of this task, we create pipelines using pre-existing SOTA models, and benchmark them on our newly created test set.
