Figure 2: Overview of StyleBooth method. We propose Multimodal Instruction, mapping the text input and exemplar image input into a same hidden space through a trainable matrix W , which unifies vision and text instructions. The textual instruction templates are carefully designed, introducing undetermined identifiers like "<style>" and "<image>" to support multimodal inputs. To balance every style for compositional style editing, we conduct Scale Weights Mechanism Î± i on the hidden space embeddings. Editing is conditioned by multimodal features following the composed instructions from different modalities at the same time.
