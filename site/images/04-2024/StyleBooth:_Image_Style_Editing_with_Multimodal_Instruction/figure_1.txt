Figure 1: Edited images by StyleBooth . Based on multimodal instructions, StyleBooth supports 3 types of image style editing. Following the same instruction template: "Let this image be in the style of <style>/<image>", we conduct (a) text-based style editing and (b) exemplar-based style editing (c) compositional style editing. "<style>" or "<image>" is the identifier of textual style name and visual exemplar images. The style name is placed under the result image and exemplar is shown at the left-bottom corner. In (c), the style name and identifier "<image>" are marked in different color fading levels. The degree of fading represents the proportion of the corresponding style in the result images. Tuned by our elegantly designed style editing data, StyleBooth is capable of generating high-quality output images in diverse styles.
