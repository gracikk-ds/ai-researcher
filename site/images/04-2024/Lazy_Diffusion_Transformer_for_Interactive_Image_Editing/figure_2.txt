Figure 2. Comparing inpainting approaches. (a) Most works [ 37 , 42 ] generate the entire image, utilizing the full image context and fill the hole by discarding the non-masked regions. While the outcome aligns well with the image, the process is timeconsuming. (b) generating only a lower resolution crop around the mask is more efficient and still seamlessly blends with nearby pixels [ 50 , 54 ]. However, the inpainted content is semantically inconsistent with the overall image context. (c) our approach ensures both global consistency and efficient execution.
