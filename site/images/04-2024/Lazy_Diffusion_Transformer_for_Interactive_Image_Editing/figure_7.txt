Figure 7. Comparing Inpainting Results: (Top) Inpainting most objects requires relatively little semantic context. In such cases, all methods produce reasonably good results, even those processing only a tight crop. (Bottom) However, when inpainting an object closely related to others, such as one bun out of many, the inpainting model requires robust semantic understanding. Methods processing only a crop produce objects that may seem reasonable in isolation, but do not fit well within the greater context of the image. In contrast, LazyDiffusion adeptly leverages the compressed image context to generate high-fidelity results, comparable in quality to models regenerating the entire image and running up to ten times slower. Additional results are provided in Figs. 11 to 14 .
