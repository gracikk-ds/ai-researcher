Fig. 4. Pipeline for dataset construction and examples of training samples. (a) Image triplet construction. We repaint the source image in the existing real-world segmentation dataset twice to form the image triplet. (b) Instruction Construction. We use multiple powerful MLLMs to caption the generated image, and combine the resulting local descriptions with instruction templates to form edit instructions. (c) Examples of the training dataset. The item in the dataset contains images before and after editing and a multi-modal instruction.
