Fig. 6. Qualitative comparisons of FreeEdit with previous methods, including mask-based methods PaintByExample, AnyDoor, MimicBrush, and mask-free methods InstructPix2Pix, Kosmos-G. Mask-based methods require the user to manually provide the mask of the editing area. AnyDoor also needs to provide a foreground mask of the reference image, and the editing mask fed to AnyDoor will be processed as a box because its training is box-based. Mask-free methods are language-based and donâ€™t require additional mask input, where we take InstructPix2Pix with detailed instructions as a baseline for comparison. The inputs required for each method are marked below each line of images. S* denotes the specific visual concept in the reference image, and O* denotes the original image to be edited.
