Figure 2: Emotions are influenced by both global and local cues from the source images. We present two image generation examples showcasing the transition from positive to negative emotions in Column 1 (shaded in blue) and two examples from negative to positive emotions in Column 2 (shaded in orange). In each example, the target emotions are in red, and source images are framed in green. Generated results from three methods are presented. Zoom in for better views.
