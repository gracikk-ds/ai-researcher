Figure 1: The generated images evoke a sense of happiness in viewers, contrasting with the negative emotions elicited by the source images. Given a source image that triggers negative emotions (framed in green), our method (Ours) synthesizes a new image that elicits the given positive target emotions (in red), while maintaining the essential elements and structures of the scene. For instance, in the first quadrant where trash on the ground evokes negative emotions, our model performs image editing by eliminating the trash while preserving the outdoor context, including trees and grass, in the same spatial arrangement as the original scene. For comparisons, we include other competitive methods (Sec.4). Zoom in for better views.
