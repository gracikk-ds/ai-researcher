Figure 4: Architecture of Our Proposed EmoEditor. EmoEditor is an image diffusion model, consisting of local (shaded in green) and global (shaded in blue) branches. The pre-trained VAEâ€™s encoder E and decoder D remain fixed throughout training and inference. Exclusively employed during inference, the fixed emotion predictor P predicts the emotions on generated images for the iterative emotion inference. See Sec.3 for details.
