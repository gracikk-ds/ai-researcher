Figure 3: Pipeline for Curating Our EmoPair Dataset. The dataset comprises two subsets: EmoPair-Annotated Subset (EPAS, left blue box) and EmoPair-Generated Subset (EPGS, right orange box). Each subset includes schematics depicting the creation, selection, and labeling of image pairs in the upper quadrants, with two example pairs in the lower quadrants. Each example pair comprises a source image (framed in green) and a target image. The classified source and target emotion labels (highlighted in red) and target-emotion-driven text instructions for image editing are provided. See more examples in Supp. Sec.S1. See Sec.3.1 for EmoPair dataset.
