Figure 3: Overview of our method. We collect a counterfactual dataset consisting of photos of scenes before and after removing an object, while keeping everything else fixed. We used this dataset to fine-tune a diffusion model to remove an object and all its effects from the scene. For the task of object insertion, we bootstrap bigger dataset by removing selected objects from a large unsupervised image dataset, resulting in a vast, synthetic counterfactual dataset. Training on this synthetic dataset and then fine tuning on a smaller, original, supervised dataset yields a high quality object insertion model.
