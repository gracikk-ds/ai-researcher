Fig. 2: The overview of the proposed pipeline for image editing with complex user requests. (a) We leverage the prior knowledge from the multimodal LLM and the zero-shot grounding model to break down the user request into multiple image editing subtasks for a single entity. (b) A pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model is used for each subtask to obtain a corresponding gradient for the source image. These gradients are masked and aggregated to get a total gradient that is efficient and stable.
