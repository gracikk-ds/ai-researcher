Figure 4: The overall pipeline of DialogGen which consists of Drawing Prompt Alignment, Training Data Curation, and Error Correction. In Drawing Prompt Alignment, re-captioning on D G is performed to ensure the alignment between transformed prompts and the T2I model. Then we carefully curate the training data such as adding object consistency guarantee, bilingual data and mixed instruction tuning data during training. Finally, we employ an error correction mechanism on student model M s to make the model learn from its mistakes.
