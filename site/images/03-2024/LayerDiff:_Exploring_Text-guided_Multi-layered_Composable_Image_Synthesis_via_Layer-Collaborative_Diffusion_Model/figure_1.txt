Fig. 1: An examples of the multi-layered composable image. The multi-layered composable image includes a background layer, a set of foreground layers and the corresponding layer masks. The layer images, layer masks and the layer prompts with the same color are belonging to the same layer. The text-guided multi-layered composable image synthesis is aimed to generate the layer images and layer masks simultaneously under the guidance of global prompt to control the holistic content, and the layer prompts to control the per layer’s content. It’s able to composite a whole image by assembling these layers according to the masks.
