Fig. 2: Overall architecture of the proposed LayerDiff. LayerDiff performs the multilayered composable image synthesis by generating the layer images and layer masks simultaneously under the guidance of both the global prompt and layer prompts. The layer-specific prompt enhancer ensures the layer text conditions to guide the content generation in each layer. In the layer collaborative diffusion model, the layercollaborative attention block learns the cross-layer relationship and injects the text guidance signal into the model.
