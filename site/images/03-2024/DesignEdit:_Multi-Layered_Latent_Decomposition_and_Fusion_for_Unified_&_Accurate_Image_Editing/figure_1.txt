Figure 1. Examples of visual design image editing. Our approach facilitates a range of image editing operations with a training-free and unified framework to achieve accurate spatial-aware editing of the design image. Our approach is able to manipulate different objects simultaneously, as well as implement various operations at the same time. All results are produced using one diffusion denoising process.
