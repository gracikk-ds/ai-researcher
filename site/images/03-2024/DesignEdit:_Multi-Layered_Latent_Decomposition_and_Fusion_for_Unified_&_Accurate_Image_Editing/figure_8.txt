Figure 8. Illustrating the Integrated Decomposition-Fusion Technique in occlusion-aware object editing at timestep t . To relocate the dog and ball and inpaint the occluded dog leg, we conduct Key-Masking Self-Attention twice on the background latent Z L 0 t and the canvas latent Z L 0 t respectively. ˆ M occlude represents the moved M occlude with the occluded Layer-1 Z L 1 t . The target latent is the new canvas removal latent ˆ Z C t .
