Figure 1: An illustration of GCTM and its applications â€“ solid arrows can be implemented by a single forward pass of the GCTM network. GCTMs learn to traverse the Flow Matching ODE which is capable of interpolating two arbitrary distributions q ( x 0 ) and q ( x 1 ) . GCTMs allow (a) one-step inference of ODE velocity, (b) one-step traversal between arbitrary time intervals of the ODE, (c) improved gradient-guidance by using exact posterior sample instead of posterior mean, and (d) one-step generation of varying outputs x 0 given a fixed input x 1 .
