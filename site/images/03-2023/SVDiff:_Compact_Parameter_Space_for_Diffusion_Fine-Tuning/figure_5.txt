Figure 5. Results for single subject generation . DreamBooth [ 57 ] and Custom Diffusion [ 37 ] are implemented in StableDiffusion with Diffusers library [ 75 ]. Each subfigure consists 3 samples: a large one on the left and 2 small one on the right. The text prompt under input images are used for training and the text prompt under sample images are used for inference. We observe that SVDiff performs similarly as DreamBooth (full-weight fine-tuning), and preserves subject identities better than Custom Diffusion for row 2, 3, 5.
