Figure 10. (a) Correlation of individually learned spectral shifts for different subjects. The cosine similarities between the spectral shifts of two subjects are averaged across all layers and plotted. The diagonal shows average similarities between two runs with different learning rates. (b) Textand image-alignment for singlesubject generation. The generated image is denoted as ˜ x . The text-alignment is measured by the CLIP score [ 14 , 51 ] cos(˜ x , c ) , and the image-alignment is defined as 1 −L LPIPS (˜ x , x ∗ ) [ 84 ].
