Figure 3. Cut-Mix-Unmix data-augmentation for multi-subject generation . The figure shows the process of Cut-Mix-Unmix data augmentation for training a model to handle multiple concepts. The method involves (a) manually constructing image-prompt pairs where the image is created using a CutMix-like data augmentation [ 82 ] and the corresponding prompt is written as, for example, “photo of a [ V 2 ] sculpture and a [ V 1 ] dog”. The prior preservation image-prompt pairs are created in a similar manner. The objective is to train the model to separate different concepts by presenting it with explicit mixed samples. (b) To perform unmix regularization, we use MSE on non-corresponding regions of the cross-attention maps to enforce separation between the two subjects. The goal is to encourage that the dog’s special token should not attend to the panda and vice versa. (c) During inference, a different prompt, such as “photo of a [ V 1 ] dog sitting besides a [ V 2 ] sculpture”.
