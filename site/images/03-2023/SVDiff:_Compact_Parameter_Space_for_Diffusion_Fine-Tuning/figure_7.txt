Figure 7. Results for single image editing . SVDiff (“Ours”) enables successful image edits despite slight misalignment with the original image. SVDiff performs desired modifications when full model fine-tuning (“Full”) fails, such as removing an object (2nd edit in (a)), adjusting pose (2nd edit in (c)), or zooming in (3rd edit in (d)). The backgrounds in some cases may be affected, however, the subject of the image remains well-preserved. For ours, we use DDIM inversion [ 65 ] for all edits in (a,c,e) and the first edit in (d).
