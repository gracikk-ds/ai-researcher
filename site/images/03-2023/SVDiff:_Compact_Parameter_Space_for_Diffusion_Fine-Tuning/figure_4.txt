Figure 4. Pipeline for single image editing with a text-to-image diffusion model. (a) The model is fine-tuned with a single imageprompt pair, where the prompt describes the input image without a special token. (b) During inference, desired edits are made by modifying the prompt. For edits with no significant structural changes, the use of DDIM inversion [ 65 ] has been shown to improve the editing quality.
