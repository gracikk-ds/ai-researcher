Figure 6. Results for multi-subject generation . (a-d) show the results of fine-tuning on two subjects and (e-g) show the results of fine-tuning on three subjects. Both full weight (“Full”) fine-tuning and SVDiff (“SVD”) can benefit from the Cut-Mix-Unmix dataaugmentation. Without Cut-Mix-Unmix, the model struggles to disentangle subjects of similar categories, as demonstrated in the last two columns of (a,b,c,d,g).
