Figure 5. (a) How to extract style maps? During training, we extract their style codes from ground truth images or randomly sampled images and then generate style maps by broadcasting. During inference, we sample a class-specific style code directly from the style bank. (b) The structure of Semantic-Style Normalization Module (SSNM) . (c) We build a Style-Diversity Object Generator equipped with SSNM .
