Figure 2. Examples of biases introduced by Prompt-to-Prompt in the InstructPix2Pix dataset. Each example shows an input image and its corresponding edited image (generated by Prompt-to-Prompt) along with the associated edit instruction. (a) Attribute-entangled edits : modifying the ladyâ€™s dress also unintentionally changes the background. (b) Scene-entangled edits: transforming the cottage into a castle affects surrounding elements. (c) Global scene changes: converting the image to black and white alters the entire scene.
