Figure 1. Our system performs programmatic edits on pattern images without inferring their underlying programs. (Left) Desired edits, expressed with a pair of patterns ( A, A ′ ) , are executed on a target pattern B by a generative model to produce B ′ . (Right) Parametric changes A → A ′ enabled by our domain-specific pattern language induce corresponding changes to the more complex pattern B .
