Figure 5. (Left) T RI F USER is a latent diffusion model conditioned on patch-wise tokens of the input images ( A, A ′ , B ) to generate the analogically edited pattern B ′ . (Right) To achieve high-quality edits, we enrich these tokens by fusing multi-level features from multiple encoders, followed by a 3D positional encoding: 2D to specify spatial locations and 1D to specify the token’s source ( A , A ′ or B ).
