Figure 1: Data examples of instruction-guided image editing in HumanEdit . Our dataset encompasses six distinct editing categories. In the images, gray shapes represent masks, which are provided for every photograph. Moreover, approximately half of the dataset includes instructions that are sufficiently detailed to enable editing without masks. It is important to note that, for conciseness, masks are depicted directly on the original images within this paper; however, in the dataset, the original images and masks are stored separately.
