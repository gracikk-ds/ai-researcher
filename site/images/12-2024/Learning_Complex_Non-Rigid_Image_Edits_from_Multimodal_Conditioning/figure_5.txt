Figure 5. Using pose conditioning is insufficient to specify personobject interactions. Combining textual embeddings allows the model to contextualize how the person interacts with their surroundings. For example, the exercise ball or bicycle are faithfully maintained with text on Rows 3 and 4, but not with just pose. We show qualitative improvement of person-object interactions by conditioning on weakly generated captions, combined with reference images and pose data. We use the pose from the ground truth combined with the pose from the reference image for conditioning, fed through a single learnable dense layer.
