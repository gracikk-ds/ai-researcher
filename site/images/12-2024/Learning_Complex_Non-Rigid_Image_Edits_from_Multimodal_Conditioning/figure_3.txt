Figure 3. Comparison of our approach to baselines for identity preservation and controllability of in-the-wild images. The input image is controlled using the prompts below each row, and the human subject is transferred to new frames for relevant models (our’s and Kulal et al.). No baseline achieves comparable identity-preserving non-rigid edits on in-the-wild data. Baselines either insert a person without controllability (Kulal et al.), or are controllable but fail to generalize to in-the-wild images (MASACtrl, PIDM). Our approach maintains similar photorealism to Kulal et al., with improved controllability. * PIDM works well on its training dataset but is brittle in the wild, likely due to its fashion-related training dataset. † Kulal et al. results are from the re-trained model with image conditioning only.
