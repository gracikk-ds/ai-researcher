Figure 1. Given a single image, multiple controllable identitypreserving edits can be specified with different text captions. Given a masked insertion scene and reference image containing a person to insert, our fine-tuned model inserts them into the scene controllable as controlled by a given text caption. Text and image-based inference on unseen images using an image + text model. Where captions are unavailable, we train the text and image model on a blank caption.
