Figure 2. Complex edits are achievable through weakly annotated supervision of a portion of the overall dataset, and finetuning jointly on text. Given a masked scene to insert a person into ("Scene") and a segmented crop of the person ("Ref"), the person is inserted into the scene. For comparison, we also provide the ground truth image that is paired with the caption and input. Given a scene, and person to insert, our model is capable of multiple non-rigid edits that preserve the identity of the person, despite a relatively small set of 13,487 weakly annotated captioned image pairs out of 78,000 videos. See Appendix Table 1 for dataset details and Section 3.3 for details on our weakly annotated captions.
