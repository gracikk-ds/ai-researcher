Figure 2. The overview of DreamOmni. (a) The DreamOmni framework supports unified image generation and editing, with fast training convergence and powerful performance. (b) To overcome the difficulty and inefficiency in data creation and filtering for image editing, we propose a collage-based synthetic data pipeline. This pipeline enables the efficient creation of data for various editing tasks, such as adding, deleting, and replacement operations in instruction-based editing, as well as translation, scaling, and rotation in drag editing. Additionally, it supports reference image generation and segmentation & detection. Furthermore, our synthetic data pipeline enhances the accuracy of T2I generation, particularly for attributes related to text, geometry, color, position, and quantity. Due to space limitations, we have optionally shown the corresponding prompts or instructions for these cases.
