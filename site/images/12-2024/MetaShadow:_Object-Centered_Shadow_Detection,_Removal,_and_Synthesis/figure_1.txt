Figure 1. MetaShadow is a versatile three-in-one framework designed for shadow-related tasks, enabling shadow manipulation in various object-centered image editing operations such as: [I] Object Relocation: Our model can detect and remove the shadow of an existing object, then synthesize the shadow in the new location consistent with the original shadow. [II] Remove an object and its shadow: (1) Based on the mask of the unwanted object, our model can directly remove its shadow (2). After removing the object (3), we can eliminate any remaining shadows for a cleaner background (4) if we do not specify which shadow to remove. [III] Insert an object and synthesize its shadow: When inserting the person in (b) to another image (a) with similar lighting, our model can generate a realistic shadow, enhancing the final compositing quality.
