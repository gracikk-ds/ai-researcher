Figure 1: (Left) A causal graph depicting the causal relationships among features. (Right) Image editing results are displayed, with the first row showing edits incorporating causal relations, and the second row without them. Each column represents a unique counterfactual query, altering the age, gender, and gray hair of the individuals. These instances provide preliminary evidence that the causal approach introduced in this paper ensures the preservation of the relevant causal invariances for the query across both factual and counterfactual images.
