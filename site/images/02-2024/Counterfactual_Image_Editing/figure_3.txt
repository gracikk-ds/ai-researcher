(b) Figure 3: (a) The proxy generator c M is compatible with the same observational distributions with the unobserved true model but is not guaranteed to induce the same image counterfactual distributions. (b) Two different image counterfactual distributions in Example 3.2 . Each sample from a P ( I , I Y =0 ) has an initial image i and a counterfactual image i â€² Y =0 . Sampling from the red part of distributions, counterfactual images do not contain gray hair. Sampling from the blue part of distributions, counterfactual images have gray hair.
