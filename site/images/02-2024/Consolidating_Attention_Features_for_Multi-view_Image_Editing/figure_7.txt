Figure 7. Our progressive denoising process is analogous to a zipper mechanism. Each step of a zipper relies on the closure of all preceding parts, and benefits from the fact that they got closer together. The dotted red curves (left) illustrate the queries generated along the diffusion process of two views. The zipper represents the QNeRF that consolidates the red dots, and projects them to form the orange dots (left) which sit along closer trajectories. After a few steps, we repeat this process with the orange and green curves (right), progressively consolidating the generated queries.
