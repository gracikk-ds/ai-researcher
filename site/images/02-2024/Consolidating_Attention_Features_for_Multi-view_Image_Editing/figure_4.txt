Figure 4. We simultaneously generate multi-view edited images with a diffusion model. To consolidate the images, along the denoising process we (1) extract self-attention queries from the network, (2) train a NeRF (termed QNeRF) on the extracted queries and render consolidated queries, and (3) softly inject the rendered queries back to the network for each view. We repeat these steps throughout the denoising process.
