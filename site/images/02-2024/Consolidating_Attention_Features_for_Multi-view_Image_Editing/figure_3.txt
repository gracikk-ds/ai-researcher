Figure 3. The first and third rows show images captured from different viewpoints. When these are individually edited using ControlNet [ 59 ] and MasaCtrl [ 8 ], inconsistencies arise. Note the shape of the lamp (top) or the distance of the foot from the wall (bottom). Images were edited using 2D controls projected from a shared 3D model (skeleton, box). The leftmost column shows controls corresponding to view 1.
