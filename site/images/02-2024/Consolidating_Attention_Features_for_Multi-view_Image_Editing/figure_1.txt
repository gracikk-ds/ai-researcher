Figure 1. Given an object-centric multi-view image set (center), we edit all images simultaneously (left and right), using 3D geometric control, such as changing the body skeleton. To promote consistency across different views, we leverage an image diffusion model and introduce QNeRF, a query feature space neural radiance field, to progressively consolidate attention features during the generation process.
