Figure 6. In each multi-view denoising interval we have query-guided steps, followed by steps without guidance. In query-guided steps, we alter the noisy latent code with an objective of proximity between the self-attention queries generated by the latent code, and queries rendered from the QNeRF. At the last step of the interval, we extract the generated queries and use them to train the QNeRF that provides guidance for the next interval. Query guidance consolidates the geometry across the different views. In addition, we inject the keys and values of self-attention layers from the original images to preserve the appearance.
