Input Input Target IN2N-CN CSD-CN TokenFlow Ours Control Image Control Figure 9. Qualitative comparison of our approach with baseline methods. Techniques relying on “dataset update”, such as IN2N-CN and CSD-CN, struggle to alter the geometry. This can be seen in the noisy depth of the statue’s right arm when using IN2N-CN, and the ghostly right arm of the statue with CSD-CN. TokenFlow struggles to preserve the appearance of the original image, and tends to produce noisy geometry, suggesting a lack of consistency between the edited frames. Our method preserves the appearance of the original images while changing the geometry consistently.
