Figure 3: Point & Instruct harnesses the power of LLMs to process a variety of instructions and leverages visual information specified by simple geometric objects. The flexibility of text prompts can be seamlessly combined with familiar GUI elements, making it simple to understand and use. In our example use-case, a user would (A) upload an existing image or write a text prompt to generate an image, (B) select object(s) with a bounding box specified through direct manipulation, (C) specify another location to move an object to with a bounding box or star, (D) click enter or a button to run the generation process, and finally (E) view the generated image.
