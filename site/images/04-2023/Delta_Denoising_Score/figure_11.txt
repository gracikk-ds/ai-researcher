Figure 11: Image-to-Image translation comparison. Our multi-task network was trained to translate cats to different animals (lion, dog, squirrel) using DDS. It was trained on synthetic cat photos and evaluated on a subset of real images from the COCO and Imagenet datasets. Our results (second row) better preserve the structure of the cat in the input image as well as its background.
