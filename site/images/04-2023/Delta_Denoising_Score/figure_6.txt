Figure 6: Unsupervised training for multi task image-toimage translation network. Given an input image ˆz (left) and a sampled task embedding (top), our network is trained using the Delta Denoising Score (DDS) and corresponding text embeddings (bottom) that describe the input image and the desired edited image result z . During inference, our network can then translate arbitrary real images based on the speciﬁed task, within a single feedforward pass.
