Figure 1: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) vs. Delta Denoising Score (DDS). Top: SDS mechanism optimizes a given image by querying the denoising model on the noisy version of the image and a target text prompt. The resulting image can often be blurry and unfaithful to the target prompt. Bottom: DDS queries an additional reference branch with a matched text-prompt, and generates delta scores that represent the difference between the outputs of the two queries. DDS provides cleaner gradient directions that modify the edited portions of the optimized image, while leaving the other parts unchanged.
