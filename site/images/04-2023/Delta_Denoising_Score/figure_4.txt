Figure 4: DDS gradients. Top: Visualization of 4 steps in the DDS optimization process, where an image of a “Flamingo rollerskating” (left) gradually transforms into a “Stork rollerskating” (right). Bottom: By subtracting the SDS gradients of the reference image and the source prompt (left) from the SDS gradients of the edited image and the target prompt (middle), we obtain cleaner DDS gradients (right).
