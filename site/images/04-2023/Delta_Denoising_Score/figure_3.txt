Figure 3: Bias in SDS optimization. Left column: an image generated by the prompt “Panda snowboarding”. Top rows show the difference between SDS to DDS optimization when changing the animal in the prompt (“Panda” to “Squirrel”). Bottom row shows SDS optimization applied using the original prompt. Even in this case, the image becomes blurry.
