Figure 2: Sampling text-to-image diffusion models. Generation via SDS optimization starting from random noises (left) vs. conventional diffusion-based image generation (right). Both samples are generated with respect to a given text prompt (top). Generating images based on SDS only leads to less diverse results and mode collapse where the main subject in the text appears in front of a blurry background.
