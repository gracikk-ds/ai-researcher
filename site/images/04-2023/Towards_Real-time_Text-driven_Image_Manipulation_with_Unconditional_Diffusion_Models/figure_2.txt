Figure 2: Overview of the proposed approach. Training phase. Diffusion model parameters θ are updated to minimize the directional CLIP loss ( 6 ) for a single-step x 0 estimate that lack high-frequency perceptual details. Inference phase. A real image x 0 is mapped to the latent variable x t 0 using the forward diffusion process in the closed-form ( 1 ). The edited image is generated for a few steps of the DDIM decoding that sequentially applies the learned transform and recovers the ﬁne-grained details.
