Figure 2. An overview of our model. (a) Our inference pipeline. Starting from a noise latent code, our model edits the source person given the source image, the target pose, the visual prompt (optional), and the text prompt (optional). Blue arrow is the reposing flow, which is also the base flow for all tasks. Pink dashed arrow indicates the optional virtual try-on flow that takes a clothing image as its input. In try-on task, the clothing image should replace the source image as the input to the pose-warping module. Brown dashed arrow is the optional text manipulation flow, which accepts a text description as its prompt. (b) The introduced pose-warping module. It maps the original RGB pixels of the source texture to the target pose based on pose correspondences. Best view in color.
