Figure 1. We propose SmartEdit, an instruction-based image editing model that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance the understanding and reasoning capabilities of instruction-based editing methods. With the specialized design, our SmartEdit is capable of handling complex understanding (the instructions that contain various object attributes like location, relative size, color, and in or outside the mirror) and reasoning scenarios.
