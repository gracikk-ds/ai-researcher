Figure 1: Latent Flow Matching for image editing. Starting from the original image, we extract the latent feature x from the frozen encoder. Then, Flow Matching is applied in latent space to transfer the trajectory between the latent feature and standard Gaussian noise by integration on the vector field. An editing operation can be triggered in u -space and Prompt by your own desire. The edited feature will be fed back to the decoder to generate the final edited image.
