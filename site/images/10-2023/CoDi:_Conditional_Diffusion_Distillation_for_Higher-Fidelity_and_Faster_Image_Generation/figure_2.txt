Figure 2. Sampled results between distilled models learned with alternative conditional guidance. Left curves shows the quantitative performance between the LPIPS and FID in { 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 } steps. Right part show the visual results where each result comes from the 1 sampling step (top) or 4 sampling steps (bottom). The distance function from the left to right is ∥ x − E ( D (ˆ x θ ( z t , c ))) ∥ 2 2 , ∥ D ( x ) − D (ˆ x θ ( z t , c )) ∥ 2 2 , F lpips ( D ( x ) , D (ˆ x θ ( z t , c )) , and our default ∥ x − ˆ x θ ( z t ) ∥ 2 2 , respectively.
