Figure 7: Fidelity of Edited Images to Original Images. (a) Average FID Heusel et al. (2017) score computed between the original images and the edited images across all the 8 methods tested on E DIT V AL . Lower FID score quantitatively indicates a better image quality. (b) Average DINO score between the original images and the edited images across all the 8 methods tested on E DIT V AL . We find that for certain methods such as Textual-Inversion, the edited images change significantly from the original images across all edit categories. For spatial changes, we find that the edited images do not change significantly across different methods. a strong noteworthy correlations, as can be seen with object-addition having correlation between 0.6 and 0.7, while positional-addition and alter-parts attains only moderate correlations ranging from 0.45 to 0.6. These scores support the alignment of our automated pipeline with human ground-truth annotations.
