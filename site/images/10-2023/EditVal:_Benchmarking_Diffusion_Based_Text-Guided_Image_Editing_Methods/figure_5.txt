Figure 5: Evaluation on E DIT V AL using OwL-ViT across eight state-of-the-art text-guided image editing methods. We find that while the text-guided image editing methods perform satisfactorily for edits corresponding to object manipulation, they suffer on edits requiring spatial knowledge such as positional-addition or position-replacement . Overall, we find Instruct-Pix2Pix , Null-Text and SINE to perform well across the majority of the editing types.
