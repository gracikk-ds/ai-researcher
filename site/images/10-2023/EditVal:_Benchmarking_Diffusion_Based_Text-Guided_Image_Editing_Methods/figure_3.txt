Figure 3: Template for the AMT Human Study: A single task displays an edit operation, a source image, an edited image from a given image-editing method and a set of questions to assess edit fidelity. Note that our human-study template does not require edited images from other methods to compare the given text-guided image editing method under evaluation (For e.g., TedBench (Kawar et al., 2023) requires edited images from all other methods). This makes our human-study template scalable and it can be independently used with any new editing method.
