Figure 1: Qualitative Examples from Image Editing on E DIT V AL . We find that for non-spatial edits (e.g., Changing background, color of an object, adding objects ), Instruct-Pix2Pix performs well, while other methods struggle. For spatial edits (e.g., Position-replacement), none of the editing methods lead to effective edits. apart particular aspects of an edit, for example, if changing the position of a particular object leaves the rest of the image unchanged (Gokhale et al., 2023). These gaps could be addressed by using human evaluators, but this is usually not scalable and thus limits the scope of edits and datasets that can be considered. Moreover, human studies often lack a standardized protocol, making it difficult to fairly compare methods.
