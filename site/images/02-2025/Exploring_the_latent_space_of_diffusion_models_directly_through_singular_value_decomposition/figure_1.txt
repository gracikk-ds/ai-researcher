Figure 1. Our framework overview for image editing. (1) During the denoising process, we select one time step T x for introducing new attributes. (2) Two latent codes x T x and z T x +∆ τ , guided by a pair of text prompts, is fed into our proposed AVI algorithm. (3) The AVI outputs a latent code y pred to replace x T x to continue the denoising process with the guidance of the original text prompt. Note that the SVD is performed channel-wise.
