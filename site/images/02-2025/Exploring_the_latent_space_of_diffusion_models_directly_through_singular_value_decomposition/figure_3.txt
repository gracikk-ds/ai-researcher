Figure 3. Representative examples shown on the attributes that one single singular vector affects across the time steps in Stable Diffusion Models (ver-2.1). Starting from the second column, the rows show the impact of singular values, and the columns present the attributes that different singular vectors may affect. Texts on the left side of images denote the attributes that a singular vector affects. It is noticeable that attribute vectors (e.g., belt details) ordered in lower places at later time steps (e.g, last row under 0.7 T ) ascended to higher places at earlier time steps (e.g, 0.6 T )
