Fig. 10. A comparison on synthetic benchmark against Latent Blending [ Avrahami et al . 2023b ] and SDXL Inpainting [ Podell et al . 2024 ] using ground truth masks ( ✓ ) against our predicted masks ( ✗ ). We observe PartEdit outperforming Latent Blending, which fails totally in some of the edits (spiderman, hair, and chair), while others produce unintegrated edits, such as the bear head. More detailed comparisons can be found on the website.
