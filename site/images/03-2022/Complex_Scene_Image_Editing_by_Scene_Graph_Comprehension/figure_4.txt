Figure 4: Qualitative examples for editing 512 Ã— 512 images on Visual Genome. The original region of the target object, desired region for the target object are outlined by red bounding box and purple bounding box respectively. We simplify the scene graphs for better visualiation. SGC-Net not only predicts desired regions for the target objects but also edits these regions based on user modifications better than prior work. See Section 4.2 for discussion.
