Figure 3: Qualitative examples for editing 256 Ã— 256 images on CLEVR. Tasks from top to bottom: semantic relationship change, object addition, object replacement, and object removal. Blank image means the corresponding approach is not capable of this task. We outline the RoI by red bounding boxes. We observe that SGC-Net can accurately predict the RoI and edit objects in complex scenes. See Section 4.1 for discussion.
