Figure 1: Prior work on text-to-image editing generally follow two approaches: (A), editing the entire image ( e.g ., Imagic [ 11 ] or Dreambooth [ 31 ]), or (B), localizing the Region of Interest (RoI) through user-provided bounding boxes or object detection ( e.g ., GroundedSAM [ 12 , 19 ]+Stable Diffusion [ 30 ]). In our work, shown in (C), we localize the RoI (outlined by the red bounding box) and predict the desired region (outlined by the purple bounding box) for the target object using a scene graph of an input image. This enables us to perform many editing operations in complex scenes, such as relationship change and object replacement, which were not supported by prior work.
