Figure 2: SGC-Net overview. Our approach consists of two sequential stages: (A) RoI prediction, which localizes the RoI based on a modified scene graph. Specifically, a scene graph encoder takes the modified scene graph as input and outputs a bounding box. (B) Regionbased image editing: During inference, we take the image masked by predicted bounding boxes as input and outputs the modified image. During training, we randomly mask out objects to simulate the output of our RoI prediction module, and train our model to reconstruct the original image. Thus, our model does not require image pairs before and after editing.
