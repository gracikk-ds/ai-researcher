Figure 4. The qualitative comparison of the proposed ours(auto seg.) and related works on the CUB dataset. Existing methods lack details (e.g., eyes, patterns, etc.), and fail to preserve the text-irrelevant content. In contrast, by adopting semantic map information and the super-resolution method, this method successfully keeps text-irrelevant content and generates better text-relevant content.
