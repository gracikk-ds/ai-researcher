Figure 1. Given an image and text instruction that reveals desired modifications to the image, our method first tries to understand the image and localize where should be modified, then makes appropriate manipulations. In addition, our network design also allows users to adjust the affected area and add/redo image manipulations for undesired results. As an advantage, this work provides effective image manipulations with high controllability, such as changing an objectâ€™s attributes (e.g., colors and texture), enlarging, dwindling, removing objects, and replacing the background.
