“Industrial design bedroom furniture...” “add a bedroom” Figure 9. Comparison with other editing methods. The input is transformed either by edit string (last two columns) or the groundtruth output image caption (middle two columns). We compare our method against two recent works, SDEdit [ 39 ] and Text2Live [ 6 ]. We show SDEdit in two conﬁgurations: conditioned on the output caption (OP) and conditioned on the edit string (E).
