Figure 3. Random masks (left) frequently capture background or intersect object boundaries, deﬁning regions that can be plausibly inpainted just from image context alone. Object masks (right) are harder to inpaint from image context alone, encouraging models to rely more on text inputs during training. (Note: This example image was generated by Imagen and is not in the training data.)
