Figure 7. Single-image human evaluations of text-guided image inpainting on EditBench by prompt type . In this ﬁgure, for Mask-Simple and Mask-Rich prompts, text-image alignment is only counted as correct if the edited image correctly includes every attribute and object speciﬁed in the prompt, including the correct attribute binding (setting a very high bar for correctness). Note that due to different evaluation designs, Full vs Mask-only prompts results are less directly comparable.
