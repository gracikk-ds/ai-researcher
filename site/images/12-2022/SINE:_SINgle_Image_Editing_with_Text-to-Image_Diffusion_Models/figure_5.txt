Figure 5. Comparisons of various methods. We compare our method to DreamBooth [ 33 ] and Textual-Inversion [ 9 ]. On the left part of the figure, we edit at the resolution same as training time. On the right part, we edit the source image at a higher resolution. Our work successfully edits the image as required while preserving the details of the source images. We also compare our method without and with the patch-based fine-tuning mechanism (w/o pos vs. w/ pos). When editing at a fixed resolution, two settings perform equally, while at a higher resolution, the patch-based fine-tuning method successfully prevents artifacts.
