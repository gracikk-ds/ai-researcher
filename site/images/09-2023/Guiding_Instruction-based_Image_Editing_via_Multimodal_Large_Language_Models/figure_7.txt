Figure 7: Qualitative comparison between InsPix2Pix, LGIE, and our MGIE. For the 1st example, MGIE can showcase the clear “ lightning ” in the sky and its reflection on the water. For the 2nd one, although LGIE accurately targets the Christmas tree, only MGIE removes it in the background. For photo optimization (the 3rd example), InsPix2Pix fails to adjust the brightness, and LGIE makes the whole photo white and obviously distinct. In contrast, MGIE follows the instruction to brighten as well as sharpen it. Moreover, in the 4th one, MGIE puts the “ glaze ” only on the donuts, but baselines even draw the entire image in strawberry pink.
