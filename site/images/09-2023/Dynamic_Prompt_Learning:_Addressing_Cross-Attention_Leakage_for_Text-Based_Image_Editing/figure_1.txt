Figure 1: Compared with other image editing methods, our DPL achieves more consistent layout when modifying one or more objects in the image and keeping other content frozen. And also the desired editing is correctly delivered to the corresponding area. DiffEdit [ 9 ] method thoroughly fails to detect the editing region in multi-object cases. And Null-Text inversion (NTI [ 28 ]) is unable to perfectly distinguish the objects in the given image since the cross-attention maps are suffering background leakage ( yellow circle) and distractor object leakage ( red circle). DPL can more successfully localize the objects in the textual prompts, thus benefits for future editing. Here the 16 Ã— 16 cross-attention maps are interpolated to the image size for better view.
