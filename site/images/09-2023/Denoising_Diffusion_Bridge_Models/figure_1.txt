Figure 1: A schematic for Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. DDBM uses a diffusion process guided by a drift adjustment (in blue) towards an endpoint x T = y . They lears to reverse such a bridge process by matching the denoising bridge score (in orange), which allows one to reverse from x T to x 0 for any x T = y âˆ¼ q data ( y ) . The forward SDE process shown on the top is unidirectional while the probability flow ODE shown at the bottom is deterministic and bidirectional. White nodes are stochastic while grey nodes are deterministic.
