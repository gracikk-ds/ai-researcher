Figure 5: We perform fine-tuning on the CM3Leon model using a vast assortment of combined image and text tasks. Our retrieval augmented pretraining allows us to fine-tune the model effectively on a mixture of interleaved texts and images, as well as text-to-image and image-to-text tasks. We present some common model inputs for various tasks on the left, with the corresponding model outputs displayed on the right. Throughout the training process, we concatenate the model input and output and train them using the same objective that was utilized during the pretraining stage.
