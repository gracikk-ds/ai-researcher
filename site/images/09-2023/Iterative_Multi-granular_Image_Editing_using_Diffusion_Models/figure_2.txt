Figure 2. While iteratively passing an image through the diffusion model [ 2 ], we see noisy artifacts being added in successive steps (we illustrate 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 steps) in Row 1. We see a similar phenomena while only auto-encoding the same image iteratively (here, the diffusion model is not used) in Row 2. Finally, when we iterate in the latent space (where z e +1 img is passed iteratively), we see that the successive images are robust to such noisy artifacts.
