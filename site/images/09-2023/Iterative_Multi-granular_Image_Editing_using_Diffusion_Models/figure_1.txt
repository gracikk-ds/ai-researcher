Figure 1. We introduce EMILIE : Iterative Multi granular Image Editor, a diffusion model that can faithfully follow a series of image editing instructions from a user. In this example, we see how the image of the fox has been semantically modified according to the provided edit instructions. Optionally, a user can instruct EMILIE with exact location of the desired edit, as illustrated in the last column.
