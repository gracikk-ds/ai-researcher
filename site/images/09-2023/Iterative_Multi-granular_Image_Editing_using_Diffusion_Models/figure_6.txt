Figure 6. Here we compare EMILIE with three baselines on images from IMIE-Bench. ‘Iterative PnP’ and ‘Iterative iP2P’ refers to Plug and Play [ 28 ] and Instruct Pix2Pix [ 2 ], where the latest edited image is recursively passed on in the next edit step. ‘Concatenating Captions’ refers to the setting where all the edit instructions that have been received so far, is concatenated and send through Instruct Pix2Pix [ 2 ] to edit the original image. We see that EMILIE is able to consistently reduce the noisy artefact accumulation and retain semantics of earlier steps better. Please see more results in the Supplementary material.
