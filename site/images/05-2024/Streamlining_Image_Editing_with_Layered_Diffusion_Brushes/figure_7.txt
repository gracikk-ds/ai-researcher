Figure 7: Results of editing MagicBrush dataset images using different methods: InstructPix2Pix, SD-Inpainting, and Layered Diffusion Brushes. These images were generated by users during the user study. While MagicBrush provides the input mask and editing prompts, users had the option of fine-tuning the mask, modifying the prompts, and selecting the best output. The last column corresponds to the provided MagicBrush ground truth images. Edit instructions (for InstructPix2Pix) and prompt (for SD-Inpainting and Layered Diffusion Brushes) are presented on top of each row.
