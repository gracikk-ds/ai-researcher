Figure 2: Overview of the proposed method: The top row shows the typical DM composition of an image from a noisy latent 𝑍 0 and a prompt 𝑃 . The bottom shows the overview of the proposed method: the algorithm takes a new seed 𝑆 ′ , and combines it with the original latent at step 𝑛 using a mask 𝑚 , and a strength control 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 . The diffusion process moves forward and at a certain step 𝑡 (we fix 𝑡 = 𝑁 − 2 ) the original latent and the new modified latent are merged together using the previous layer’s intermediate latent and masking and finally the edited image is generated.
