Figure 2: The automated pipelines for generating editing pairs, which constitutes the first part of SEED-Data-Edit. In pipeline (a), an object is first segmented and subsequently removed with an inpainting module, which results in a set of “Remove” and “Add” editing samples. In pipeline (b), an image-guided text-to-image generation model is utilized to generate source images and target images based on the original image, the original caption and the target caption after editing.
