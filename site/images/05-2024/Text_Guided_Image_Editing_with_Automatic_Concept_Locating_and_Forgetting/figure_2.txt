Figure 2: Our framework for our method Locate and Forget (LaF). LaF consists of two parts: 1) Alignment of the input text prompt with the visual scene information: By comparing the textual instructions to the scene description of the image’s contents, the LaF model can identify the specific concepts and attributes in the visual scene that need to be edited. 2) Selective forgetting during the diffusion process: During the denoising steps, identified forgettable elements as a form of negative guidance to be removed, which allows to selectively forget the influence of the visual elements that are not aligned with the user’s intent.
