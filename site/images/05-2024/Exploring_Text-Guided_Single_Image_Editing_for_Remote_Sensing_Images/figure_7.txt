Fig. 7. The prompt-guided fine-tuning process of SinDDM. After the training procedure, the encoder of the SinDDM is frozen and its decoder is fine-tuned through promptâ€™s guidance. The ROI prompt is added to the original image to mask the areas that do not need editing, while the text prompts would be augmented with PE. Then, we use the frozen image encoder and text encoder of the CLIP to generate corresponding embeddings of the edited image and text prompt, respectively. Finally, we use cosine similarity loss between the two above embeddings as the optimization objective to fine tune the decoder of the SinDDM.
