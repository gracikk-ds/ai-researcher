Fig. 3. The multi-scale training strategy. The forward multi-scale diffusion process (left) construct a sequence of images that are linear combinations of the original images in multi scale, their blurry version, and noise. For the sampling process via reverse multi-scale diffusion (right) starts from pure noise at the coarsest scale. In each scale, SinDDM gradually removes the noise until reaching a clean image, which is then upsampled and combined with noise to start the process again in the next scale. It is worth noting that the above process uses a multi-scale training strategy, so just a single image could achieve effective training of DDPM.
