Figure 4: Qualitative analysis of VLM-guided blind restoration for desnowing, dehazing, and lowlight enhancement. The results are obtained from PromptFix without explicit task instructions, relying solely on the input image. The auxiliary prompt, automatically generated by a VLM during inference, includes semantic captions and defect descriptions, indicated by < blue > and < yellow > tags, respectively.
