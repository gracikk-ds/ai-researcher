Figure 6. Comparisons between existing works and our method. Part a) shows comparisons with paired-data methods, while part b) contains results comparing with few/zero-shot methods including methods editing in the latent space and methods relying on the multi-modal information. Note that for the latter methods, we will provide proper instructions which can describe the editing target.
