Figure 1: Overview of I 2 EBench, an automated system for evaluating the quality of editing results generated by instruction-based image editing (IIE) models. We collected a dataset of over 2000+ images from public datasets Lin et al. [ 2014 ], Guo et al. [ 2023b ], Martin et al. [ 2001 ], Chen et al. [ 2021 ], Ancuti et al. [ 2019 ], Liu et al. [ 2021b , a ], Qu et al. [ 2017 ], Nah et al. [ 2017 ], Shen et al. [ 2019 ], Wei et al. [ 2018 ] and annotated them with corresponding original editing instructions. To diversify the instructions, we used ChatGPT Achiam et al. [ 2023 ] to generate varied versions. With the collected images and the original/diverse editing instructions, we utilized existing IIE models to generate edited images. Subsequently, we developed an evaluation methodology to automatically assess the adherence of edited images to the provided instructions under different dimensions. We also implemented human evaluation to obtain human preferences for editing results of different IIE models. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between automated evaluation and human evaluation, confirming alignment with human perception.
