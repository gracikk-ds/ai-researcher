Figure 1: (a) Results of applying the two basic functions —Edge Enhancement (center) and Object Removal (right)—using their respective masks on the input image Best viewed when enlarged. (b) Demonstration of function aggregation using the proposed method. By simultaneously applying Object Removal and Edge Enhancement on different masks, complex edits such as object shrinking (middle) and object movement (right) can be achieved. A represents the operation of function aggregation.
