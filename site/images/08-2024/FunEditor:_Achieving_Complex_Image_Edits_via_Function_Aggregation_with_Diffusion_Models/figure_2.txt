This enables it to perform complex edit functions such as object movement, object resizing, and object pasting in 4 steps . f OR , f EE , and f HR refer to object removal, edge enhancement, and harmonization functions, respectively. Each function is applied only to the specified mask region. To save space, source image I is omitted from the function arguments.
