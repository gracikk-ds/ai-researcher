Figure 8: Qualitative comparison of expressive instructions by LGIE and our MGIE. Due to the limitation of the single modality, LGIE can only have language-based insight but may derive irrelevant or even wrong explanations for image editing ( e.g. , “ two people still in the foreground ” for GIER). With access to images, MGIE provides explicit visual imagination after the editing such as “ baby on the beach with a shark ” or “ bring out details of leaves and trunk ”. More surprisingly, we can link “ lightsaber or spaceship ” from Star Wars and describe “ chewing on the stick ” for the dog, which is aligned with the intended goal.
