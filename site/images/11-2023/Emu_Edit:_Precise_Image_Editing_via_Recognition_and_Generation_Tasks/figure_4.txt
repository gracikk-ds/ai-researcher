Figure 4. Task embeddings. Model trained without task embeddings may get confused about the edit type when the instructions are complicated or there is ambiguity regarding the edit type: (1) Global edit (instead of Texture), (2) Segmentation (instead of Global), (3) Style edit (instead of Local). errors, which translate to noticeable artifacts. To mitigate this, we add a per-pixel thresholding step after each editturn. At each step s , we use the pixel value in the output image, c s +1 I , only if its alteration surpasses a specific threshold. Otherwise, we keep the pixel value from the input image, c s I . Specifically, given an edit turn s , we compute the absolute difference image d = ∥ c s +1 I − c s I ∥ 1 over the RGB channel, and apply the following thresholding:
