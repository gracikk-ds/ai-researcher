Figure 2. (a) Inference pipeline. CompFuser employs an iterative generation process, first using text-to-image synthesis to generate a draft image (illustrated by dashed lines) and employs text-and-image-to-image generation to edit the image (depicted with solid lines). LDM refers to LLM-grounded diffusion [ 17 ]. (b) Training pipeline. This figure shows the training pipeline of our proposal, which is trained on synthesized data with image conditioning c I and text instruction c T to generate images.
