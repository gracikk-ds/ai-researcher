Fig. 2: The overview of LLMGA. (a) In the first training stage, we train the MLLM to produce generation prompts based on provided instructions. Moreover, we construct a training dataset including four categories: prompt refinement, similar image generation, inpainting & outpainting, and instruction-based editing. (b) In the second training stage, we optimize SD to adapt to the detailed generation prompts from MLLM. (c) In the inference stage, LLMGA can respond to user queries and assist in various tasks, such as image generation, inpainting & outpainting, and editing.
