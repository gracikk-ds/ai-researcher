Figure 3. Framework of the proposed method. We first feed the input image into the self-supervised learning (SSL) model, e.g ., DINO [ 7 ], to obtain the attention map and feature, which are used for anchor initialization. The region generation model initializes several region proposals ( e.g ., 3 proposals in this figure) around each anchor point, and learns to select the most suitable ones among them with the region generation network (RGN). The predicted region and the text descriptions are then fed into a pre-trained text-to-image model for image editing. We utilize the CLIP model for learning the score to measure the similarity between the given text description and the edited result, forming a training signal to learn our region generation model.
