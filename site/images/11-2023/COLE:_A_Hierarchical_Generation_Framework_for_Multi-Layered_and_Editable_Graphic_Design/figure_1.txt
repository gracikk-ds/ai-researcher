Figure 1. Illustrating the multi-layered graphic design images generated by our C OLE system (first row, we display the multi-layer image layers at the top-right corner of each design image) and the combination of DALL · E3 background images and C OLE system (second row). See the appendix for detailed intention prompts. As shown in the second row, our C OLE system skillfully plans design layouts and selects harmonious fonts, colors, sizes, and positions through insightful analysis and reasoning, even with out-of-domain DALL · E3 background images after pre-processing. By default, we do not use DALL · E3 background images in all other results.
