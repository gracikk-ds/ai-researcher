Figure 3. (a) Existing work primarily uses LLMs and diffusion models to automatically generate edited images. However, current diffusion models often fail to accurately follow text prompts while maintaining the input imageâ€™s layout, resulting in mismatches between the original-edited image pairs and the editing instructions. (b) We perform instruction rectification (Step 3) based on the images constructed in Steps 1 and 2. We show VLMs can understand the differences between the images, enabling them to rectify editing instructions to be better aligned with original-edited image pairs.
