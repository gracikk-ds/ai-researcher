Figure 4. We show that the editing model follows consistent generation attributes at different sampling stages, independent of the editing instructions. The early, middle, and late sampling stages correspond to global , local , and detail changes, respectively, while style changes occur at all stages. All the generated images here are DDIM 30-step sampled final images. The orange progress bar and the grid progress bar represent the sampling stages with and without the editing instructions, respectively.
