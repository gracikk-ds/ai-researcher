Figure 2. Illustration of DICE. We employ an MLLM and fine-tune it for two different tasks. In the first stage (difference detection), the MLLM is trained to detect semantic differences between the original image and the edited one. In the second stage (coherence estimation), the MLLM is instructed to analyze and assess the coherence of each detected difference with respect to the given user prompt.
