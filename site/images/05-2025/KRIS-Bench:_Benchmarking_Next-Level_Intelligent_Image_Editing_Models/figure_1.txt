Figure 1: (a) We present KRIS-Bench, a benchmark for instruction-based image editing grounded in a knowledge-based reasoning taxonomy. It covers 3 knowledge dimensions, 7 reasoning dimensions, and 22 editing tasks. Specific examples are shown in Figure 2 . (b) Given an editing pair of (image, instruction) under a specific reasoning dimension ( i.e. , Chemistry in Natural Science), we evaluate the output of image editing models with automated VLM tools over the proposed four complementary metrics, which are aligned with human scoring.
