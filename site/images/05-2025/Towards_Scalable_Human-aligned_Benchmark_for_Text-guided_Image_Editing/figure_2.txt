Figure 2. Overview of our HATIE Benchmark. HATIE consists of an image and query dataset for editing, along with an automated evaluation pipeline for assessing editing performance. We curate a large-scale comprehensive dataset with images and corresponding editing queries, on which a model would perform text-guided image editing. Then, HATIE evaluates the edited images from 5 different aspects: Object Fidelity, Background Fidelity, Object Consistency, Background Consistency, and Image Quality . Finally, these scores are aggregated by a weight fitted to human feedback through our user study, producing the final Total Score.
