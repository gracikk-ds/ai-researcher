While this approach is somewhat effective, it sometimes causes unwanted artifacts when interpolating between features that are significantly different (see the mirrors in Figure 3:d). To address this limitation, we explore the use of spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) for interpolating between the keys and values, which takes vector directions into account for smoother blending:
