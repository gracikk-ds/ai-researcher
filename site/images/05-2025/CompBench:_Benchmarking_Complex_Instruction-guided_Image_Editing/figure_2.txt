Figure 2: Comparison between current datasets or benchmarks and our CompBench. First row: failed cases of other benchmarks. These results fail to maintain background consistencies or introduce noticable artifacts into the editing region. Second row: Examples of other benchmarks. These cases lack scene complexity and instruction comprehensiveness. Third row: Examples of our CompBench. Our benchmark features complex real-world scenarios with precise instructions.
