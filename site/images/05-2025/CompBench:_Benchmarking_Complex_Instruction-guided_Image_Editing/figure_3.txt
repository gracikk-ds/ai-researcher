Figure 3: The construction pipeline of CompBench. The pipeline consists of two main stages: (a) Source data collection and preprocessing, wherein high-quality data are identified through image quality filtering, mask decomposition, occlusion and continuity evaluation, followed by thorough human verification. (b) Task-specific data generation using four specialized pipelines within our MLLM-Human Collaborative Framework, where multimodal large language models generate initial editing instructions that are subsequently validated by humans to ensure high-fidelity, semantically aligned instruction-image pairs for complex editing tasks.
