Figure 1: By integrating multimodal large language models, we endow generative image editing models with intricate reasoning capabilities. Our method interprets implicit user-provided contextual knowledge to control the generative pixel-level editing process, ensuring results that align faithfully with the intended modifications. The underline indicates the content that requires reasoning-based processing. More illustrations can be found in the supplementary material.
