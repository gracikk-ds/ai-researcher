Figure 3: The pipeline of R-Genie. R-Genie employs a MLLM to process an introduced <REASON> token alongside textual and visual input tokens. The MLLM-generated <EDIT> token is subsequently routed through a reasoning-attention bridge and a hierarchical reasoning module, which perform bidirectional reasoning by integrating visual features through cross-modal interactions. Finally, a discrete diffusion model reconstructs the target visual features in discrete space, ensuring alignment between the expected modified visual semantic output and the reconstructed visual representation.
