Figure 2. General pipeline for conditioning latent diffusion models with additional guidance signals. An extra condition y is processed through a condition encoder τ θ to produce a condition embedding c . This embedding guides the denoising UNet via crossattention during the iterative denoising process, which transforms the noisy latent z T into a clean latent representation z 0 over T steps. Finally, an image decoder D converts the latent representation z 0 into the final predicted conditioned image ˆ x .
