Figure 5: Single-image editing results. PaRa allows for image editing through one-shot learning of the original image and performs generation by directly modifying the prompt. We can see that PaRa achieves the expected modifications and preserves the personalized target subject well. In addition, PaRa achieves high consistency with untargeted elements of the initial image under different Gaussian noises.
