Figure 1: Multi-aspect text-driven image editing. Multiple edits in images pose a significant challenge in existing models (such as DirectInverison [ 1 ] and InfEdit [ 2 ]), as their performance downgrades with an increasing number of aspects. In contrast, our ParallelEdits can achieve precise multi-aspect image editing in 5 seconds. The symbol ⊗ denotes a swap action, the symbol ⊕ denotes an object addition action, and the symbol ⊖ denotes an object deletion . Arrows ( → ) on the image highlight the aspects edited by our method.
