Figure 2: Pipeline. Our method, ParallelEdits, takes a source image, source prompt, and target prompt as input and produces an edited image. The target prompt specifies the edits needed in the source image. Attention maps for all edited aspects are first collected. Aspect Grouping (see Section 4.2.1) categorizes each aspect into one of N groups (in the above figure, N = 5 ). Each group is then assigned a branch and the branch-level updates are detailed in Section 4.2.2. Each branch can be viewed either as a rigid editing branch, non-rigid editing branch, or global editing branch. Finally, adjustments to query/key/value at the self-attention and cross-attention layers are made, as illustrated in the figure and described in Section 4.2.3.
