Figure 3: Illustration of Non-rigid Image editing via identity-aware MAsk blend (NIMA). (a) Given a test image, we first invert it to obtain the inverted latents { x i } for image reconstruction, to further obtain the subject mask M s for the source image. (b) Afterward, to achieve non-rigid image editing, we generate the target image by blending the source x t and target Ë† x T information with the generated masks ( M s , M e t ).
