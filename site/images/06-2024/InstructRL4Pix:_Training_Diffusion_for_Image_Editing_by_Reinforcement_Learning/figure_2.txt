Figure 2. Overview of Reinforcement Learning Guided Image Editing Method(InstructRL4Pix) to train a diffusion model to generate images that are guided by the attention maps of the target object. InstructRL4Pix breaks through the limitations of traditional datasets and uses unsupervised learning to optimize editing goals and achieve accurate image editing based on natural human commands.
