Figure 1. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guided Image Editing Method(InstructRL4Pix) to unsupervised optimize instructionbased image editing for various editing tasks. The bottom is the edit instruction, the middle is the input image, and the top is the output image after InstructRL4Pix editing.
