Figure 7: The results of multi-line text editing using TextMaster , with test images sourced from the Laion and WuKong evaluation datasets. As elaborated in the main text, we curated a dataset of 300,000 images containing continuous text segments for training. During the training process, the newline character (” \ n”) was treated as an independent and special token within the prompt. Each line of text content was concatenated using ” \ n”, ensuring that the positions of text segments in the glyph images approximately matched their corresponding locations. Guided by the textual information and the injected glyph image data, our method demonstrates a robust capability for precise multi-line text editing.
