Fig. 1. Our approach predicts a scene graph as a user interface, enabling modifications to nodes and edges for various tasks, such as changing relationships or replacing, adding, and removing elements. By integrating LLM and Text2Image generative models, users can explore diverse compositions in their images, ensuring that these alterations accurately reflect the structural changes depicted in the modified scene graph.
