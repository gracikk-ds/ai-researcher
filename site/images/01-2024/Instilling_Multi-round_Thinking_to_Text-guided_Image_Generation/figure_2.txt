Fig. 2: A schematic overview of our framework. (a) Multi-round Generation: The multi-round regularization is achieved by a skip loss only supervising on final output ˜ z y 0 and ground truth z y 0 . Starting with the encoding of the reference image x into a latent embedding z x 0 , we conduct a complete denoising process twice to get ˜ z y 0 . The information of x is traced by the blue line, while the pink line indicates the flow of text information. (b) Single-round Reconstruction: In single-round reconstruction, the objective is to reconstruct the target image y by denoising on perturbed ground truth y alongside the corresponding text condition T and pose P . (c) A brief illustration of Pose-Conditioned Diffusion. Given the input c , P and z τ , the diffusion is to generate ˜ z 0 via iteratively denosing on the time step τ . We adopt an extra LoRA layer, which is concatenated into each attention block of the U-net decoder.
