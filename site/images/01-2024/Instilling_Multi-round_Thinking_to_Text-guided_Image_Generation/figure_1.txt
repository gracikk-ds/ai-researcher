Fig. 1: (a) A typical use case of multi-round interactive editing. The learned model can understand text instruction and the semantic meaning of images and craft images based on previous user feedback. This real-world scenario often involves multi-round generation rather than single-round generation. (b) Some common failure cases on the prevailing methods [ 46 ], i.e ., long sentence ignorance case, multi-facet forgetting case. We could observe the significant visual difference between generated images and ground-truth targets. (c) Here we show a typical two-round inconsistency case. The final generated results are sensitive to the order of text guidance.
