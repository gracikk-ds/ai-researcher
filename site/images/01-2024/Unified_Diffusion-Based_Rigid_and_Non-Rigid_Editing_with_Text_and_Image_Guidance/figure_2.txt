Fig. 2. An Overview of Our Approach. Given the input pairs ( I app , T struct ), ( I struct , T app ), and ( I app , I struct ), our method aims to produce the desired editing result I out 1 , I out 2 , I out 2 , which corresponds to achieving text-based non-rigid edits, text-based rigid edits, and image-based edits, respectively. During the denoising step, the source image and target guidance correspond to distinct generation processes, from where information are subsequently injected into the editing process to achieve the desired manipulation.
