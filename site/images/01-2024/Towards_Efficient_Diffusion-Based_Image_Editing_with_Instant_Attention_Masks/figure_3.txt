Figure 3: The framework of the Instant Diffusion Editing (InstDiffEdit). InstDiffEdit involves instant mask generation at each denoising step based on the attention maps. This mask can provide instant guidance for the image denoising. The left part (a) illustrates the noise process, and (b) depicts the generation of semantic mask at each step, based on which the diffusion-based image editing is performed (c). Lastly, the inpainting model is further applied to accomplish the generation (d).
