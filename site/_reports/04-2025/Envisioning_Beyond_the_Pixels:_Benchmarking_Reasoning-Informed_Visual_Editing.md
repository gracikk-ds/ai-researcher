## 1. Motivation of the Paper
The authors address the gap in evaluating a sophisticated capability emerging in Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs): **Reasoning-Informed Visual Editing (RISE)**. While LMMs have advanced in visual understanding and generation, they still struggle with editing tasks that require complex reasoning, such as following intricate instructions, preserving the appearance of unchanged parts of an image, and handling flexible inputs. The lack of a specialized benchmark makes it difficult to quantitatively measure these reasoning abilities, hindering progress in the field.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The core contribution is the introduction of **RISEBench**, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess reasoning-informed visual editing. The methodology is twofold:

- **Benchmark Design**: RISEBench is structured around four fundamental reasoning categories that are challenging for current models:
    1.  **Temporal Reasoning**: Understanding and predicting changes over time (e.g., aging, seasons).
    2.  **Causal Reasoning**: Inferring the visual outcome of an action or event (e.g., an object breaking).
    3.  **Spatial Reasoning**: Comprehending and manipulating spatial relationships (e.g., changing perspective, assembling parts).
    4.  **Logical Reasoning**: Solving visual puzzles based on abstract rules (e.g., mazes, pattern completion).

- **Evaluation Framework**: The authors propose a robust evaluation pipeline that assesses generated images along three key dimensions:
    1.  **Instruction Reasoning**: How accurately the model's output follows the given instruction.
    2.  **Appearance Consistency**: How well the model preserves visual elements of the input image that were not meant to be changed.
    3.  **Visual Plausibility**: The overall realism and quality of the generated image, ensuring it is free from artifacts.

To make evaluation scalable, the paper introduces and validates an **LMM-as-a-judge** approach, where a powerful LMM automatically scores the outputs based on detailed prompts.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
The paper presents a new benchmark dataset named **RISEBench**.
- **Size**: It consists of 360 carefully curated and human-annotated test cases.
- **Domain**: The dataset covers a diverse range of visual editing tasks requiring reasoning. Each sample includes an input image and a complex textual instruction.
- **Usage**: It is used to systematically evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of various state-of-the-art visual editing models. The distribution of tasks is: 85 for temporal, 90 for causal, 100 for spatial, and 85 for logical reasoning.

## 4. Main Results
The evaluation of eight prominent models on RISEBench reveals significant limitations in current technology.
- The best-performing model, **GPT-4o-Image**, achieved an overall accuracy of only **28.9%**.
- Other proprietary models like the Gemini-2.0-Flash series scored much lower (13.3% and 9.4%), while open-source models performed near zero.
- A key takeaway is that while models like GPT-4o-Image show promise in temporal, causal, and spatial tasks (accuracies >30%), they fail significantly at **logical reasoning** (10.6% accuracy), identifying it as a critical bottleneck for future research. The benchmark effectively demonstrates that robust, human-like reasoning in visual editing is still far from being solved.

## 5. Ablation Studies
The authors performed a validation study on their **LMM-as-a-judge** framework to ensure its reliability, which serves a similar purpose to an ablation study.
- **Experiment**: They compared the automated scores from their LMM judge with scores provided by six human experts on a random sample of 100 model outputs.
- **Impact**: The study found a strong correlation between the LMM and human judgments. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was consistently low across all three evaluation dimensions: 0.5 for Instruction Reasoning, 0.7 for Appearance Consistency, and 0.4 for Visual Plausibility (on a 1-5 scale). This result validates the use of the LMM-as-a-judge pipeline as a reliable and scalable alternative to human evaluation.
