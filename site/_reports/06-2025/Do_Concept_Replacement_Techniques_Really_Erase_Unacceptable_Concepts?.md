## 1. Motivation of the Paper
The authors address the failure of existing Concept Replacement Techniques (CRTs) in the context of image-to-image (I2I) generative models. While current CRTs claim to "erase" unacceptable concepts (e.g., celebrity likenesses, copyrighted content) by modifying model weights and appear effective in text-to-image (T2I) tasks, the paper demonstrates they fail to prevent the reconstruction of these concepts when provided as input in an I2I setting. Furthermore, the authors identify a critical gap in prior work: the neglect of **fidelity**, which is the preservation of acceptable, non-target concepts and details in an image during the correction process.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The paper's core idea is that an effective CRT must balance both **effectiveness** (successfully removing the unacceptable concept) and **fidelity** (preserving the rest of the image). Instead of modifying model weights, the authors propose **ANTIMIRROR**, a novel CRT based on targeted post-processing image editing.

The methodology is a four-step pipeline designed for celebrity likeness removal:
1.  **Face Extraction:** A face detector isolates the facial region from the generated image.
2.  **Unacceptable Concept Check:** A specialized celebrity detector (Espresso) verifies if the face belongs to a known celebrity. Editing proceeds only if a match is found.
3.  **Mask Generation & Editing:** A segmentation mask of key facial features (eyes, nose, chin, etc.) is generated. The system then automatically applies morphological and geometric transformations to this mask to alter the person's identity.
4.  **Face Blending:** The modified facial region is seamlessly blended back into the original background using Poisson blending, ensuring high fidelity.

This approach is prompt-free and model-agnostic.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
The authors generated their own evaluation dataset by using the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model to create 50 high-quality images per concept. These images were then used as inputs for the I2I reconstruction experiments. The dataset covered three categories of unacceptable concepts:
-   **Offensive:** Nudity.
-   **Copyrighted:** R2D2, Grumpy Cat.
-   **Celebrity-likeness:** Angelina Jolie, Taylor Swift, Brad Pitt, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden.

## 4. Main Results
-   **Existing CRTs are Ineffective in I2I:** State-of-the-art weight-modification CRTs (MOD, MACE, UCE) were shown to fail at preventing the reconstruction of unacceptable concepts. In experiments, the reconstruction quality and concept presence (measured by CLIP score) were nearly identical to the baseline model with no CRT applied.
-   **ANTIMIRROR Balances Effectiveness and Fidelity:** Using a specialized Giphy Celebrity Detector (GCD) as a more suitable metric, ANTIMIRROR proved highly effective, reducing celebrity detection accuracy to near-zero (e.g., a GCD score of 0.00 for Brad Pitt, down from 0.97). While the general editing tool SDEDIT was similarly effective, ANTIMIRROR demonstrated vastly superior fidelity, preserving background and non-facial features. For instance, ANTIMIRROR achieved an LPIPS score of 0.32 for Brad Pitt, significantly better than SDEDIT's 0.54 (lower is better).
-   The authors conclude that their targeted editing approach provides a superior trade-off between effectiveness and fidelity compared to existing methods.

## 5. Ablation Studies
-   **Impact of Editing Prompt Detail:** The paper showed that a general editing tool like SDEDIT requires increasingly complex and detailed prompts to preserve image fidelity. A simple prompt like "random man" drastically alters the entire image, whereas ANTIMIRROR's prompt-free design avoids this issue.
-   **Choice of Evaluation Metric:** The authors demonstrated that the commonly used CLIP score is a poor metric for evaluating targeted edits. Because ANTIMIRROR preserves most of the original image, it received poor (high) CLIP scores. However, when evaluated with a specialized Giphy Celebrity Detector (GCD), its effectiveness at removing the specific celebrity identity became clear, validating GCD as a more appropriate metric for this task.

When the unacceptable concept detector flags a reconstructed image, Gaussian noise is added to the image as part of the SDE DIT mechanism. Concurrently, an editing prompt—tailored to the original input—is encoded through a text encoder. This encoded prompt, coupled with the noisy image, guides the denoising process to produce a final output image free of unacceptable concept.]({{ '/images/06-2025/Do_Concept_Replacement_Techniques_Really_Erase_Unacceptable_Concepts?/figure_3.jpg' | relative_url }})

When a face is detected in the reconstructed image, it is isolated from the background, and passed through an unacceptable concept detector. If the detector flags the image, an image-to-mask generator constructs a mask, which is then edited to modify the face.
