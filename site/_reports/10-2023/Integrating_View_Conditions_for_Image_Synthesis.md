![Figure 1: Applications of the proposed method. Our method can replace each object in the left column with the one in the upper row, ensuring not only consistency in the synthesized object but also, by introducing viewpoint conditions to the model, enabling precise control over the object’s pose and thus enhancing visual harmony.]({{ '/images/10-2023/Integrating_View_Conditions_for_Image_Synthesis/figure_1.jpg' | relative_url }})
## 1. Motivation of the Paper
Existing image editing methods struggle to provide users with precise control over the pose (i.e., spatial orientation and position) of objects being inserted or modified within an image. Current approaches often fail to simultaneously satisfy three critical criteria: **consistency** (the synthesized object faithfully matches the reference object's appearance), **controllability** (the user can precisely dictate the object's pose), and **harmony** (the object integrates seamlessly with the scene's lighting, shadows, and perspective). This paper addresses the gap by creating a framework that explicitly incorporates viewpoint information to achieve all three goals.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The paper introduces "ViewControl," a modular framework that integrates explicit view conditions into the image synthesis pipeline using a "divide and conquer" strategy. The methodology consists of three main stages:
1.  **LLM Planner:** A Large Language Model (GPT-4) first parses a natural language instruction from the user to identify the target object, reference object, and the desired pose transformation (e.g., "turn left 90 degrees").
2.  **Pose Estimation and Synthesis:** A custom-trained pose estimation model (using a DINO-v2 backbone) extracts the 3D pose (rotation and translation) from a single image of an object. This pose information is then fed into a view-conditioned diffusion model (Zero123) to generate a new image of the reference object from the desired viewpoint.
3.  **Image Synthesis:** A personalized Stable Diffusion inpainting model, guided by dual ControlNets (for edge and color), seamlessly integrates the newly rendered object into the source image at the correct location, ensuring it harmonizes with the background.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
The authors curated a new dataset to train their pose estimation model. It contains approximately 48,600 images of various products sourced from the internet. For each product, which was initially captured from a consistent viewpoint, the authors used existing zero-shot novel view synthesis models to generate batches of images from different relative camera viewpoints. This dataset, complete with corresponding view labels, was split into an 80/20 training and testing ratio.

## 4. Main Results
The proposed ViewControl framework was quantitatively compared against state-of-the-art methods like Paint-by-Example and Paint-by-Sketch through human evaluations. On a 5-point scale, ViewControl demonstrated significantly superior performance across all key criteria:
*   **Consistency:** 4.44 (vs. 2.67 for Paint-by-Example)
*   **Harmony:** 4.54 (vs. 2.61 for Paint-by-Example)
*   **Controllability:** 4.53 (vs. 1.93 for Paint-by-Example)
The authors claim their work provides a robust solution for precise, view-aware object modification, with applications in virtual try-on and interior design.

## 5. Ablation Studies
The authors performed several ablation studies to validate their design choices:
*   **Pose Estimation Backbone:** Different backbones were tested for the pose estimation module. DINO-v2 achieved the best performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.80, outperforming ResNet-50, CLIP, and ViT.
*   **Synthesis Components:** Qualitatively removing individual components like the personalization module or the ControlNets for color and edge guidance resulted in visibly degraded output, confirming the necessity of each module for high-quality synthesis.
*   **View Conditions:** Experiments showed that without explicit view conditions, the model defaults to generating objects in a standard orientation (e.g., front-facing). The system was also found to be robust to minor errors (up to 20 degrees) in the provided view conditions.
*   **Synthesis Strategy:** A single-stage inpainting process was shown to be more effective than a two-stage approach (i.e., removing the original object, then adding the new one), as the latter tended to introduce visual artifacts in the background.

![Figure 2: An illustrative overview of our method, which is designed for synthesizing an object with a user-specified view into a scene. ”3D?” denotes whether a 3D model is available. Our approach consists of three components: Large Language Model (LLM) Planner (Sec. 3.1), Pose Estimation and Synthesis (Sec. 3.2), and Image Synthesis (Sec. 3.3). First, the LLM Planner is adopted to obtain the objects’ names and pose information based on the user’s input. Second, a segmentation module is adopted to remove the background from the specific object, followed by a pose estimation module to obtain its accurate pose. A pose synthesis module is then applied to synthesize the reference object respecting specific view conditions. Third, a personalized pre-trained diffusion model and ControlNets are adopted to produce the final synthesis. They ensure that the target object harmoniously melds with its surroundings, aligning with the user-specified view, while maintaining consistency in the object’s representation.
