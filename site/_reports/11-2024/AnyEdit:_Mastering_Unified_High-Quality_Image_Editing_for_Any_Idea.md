![Figure 1. Examples of AnyEdit at scale. We comprehensively categorize image editing tasks into 5 groups based on different editing capabilities: (a) Local Editing which focuses on region-based editing ( green area ); (b) Global Editing which focuses on the full range of image rendering ( yellow area ); (c) Camera Move Editing which focuses on viewpoints changing instead of scenes ( gray area ); (d) Implicit Editing which requires commonsense knowledge to complete complex editing ( orange area ); (e) Visual Editing which encompasses additional visual inputs, addressing the requirements for multi-modal editing ( blue area ).]({{ '/images/11-2024/AnyEdit:_Mastering_Unified_High-Quality_Image_Editing_for_Any_Idea/figure_1.jpg' | relative_url }})
## 1. Motivation of the Paper
The authors address a key limitation in instruction-based image editing: current models often fail to accurately execute complex or diverse user instructions. This failure stems from their training on low-quality datasets that have a limited scope of editing types and suffer from inherent data biases. Existing datasets lack support for complex tasks requiring multi-modal perception (e.g., spatial reasoning, viewpoint changes) or reference-based inputs (e.g., style transfer from another image), which restricts the creative potential and practical utility of editing models.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The paper introduces two main contributions: a new dataset, **AnyEdit**, and a new model, **AnyEdit Stable Diffusion (AnySD)**, designed to leverage it.

-   **AnyEdit Dataset**: The core idea is to create a comprehensive, large-scale, and high-quality dataset that covers a wide spectrum of editing tasks. The authors systematically categorize editing into five primary domains: **Local Editing** (object-level changes), **Global Editing** (scene-level changes), **Camera Movement Editing**, **Implicit Editing** (requiring commonsense reasoning), and **Visual Editing** (using visual prompts).
-   **Methodology (Dataset Creation)**: To ensure diversity and quality, the dataset was constructed using a three-part automated pipeline:
    1.  **Initial Data Diversity**: Combining real-world images with "counterfactual synthetic scenes" to mitigate concept bias in the training data.
    2.  **Adaptive Editing Process**: Employing an adaptive pipeline that automatically selects the appropriate data generation method for each of the 25 distinct editing types.
    3.  **Automated Quality Selection**: Using a multi-stage filtering strategy to validate instructions and assess edited image quality, ensuring high-fidelity results.
-   **Methodology (AnySD Model)**: The AnySD model is built upon Stable Diffusion and incorporates two key architectural designs to handle the dataset's diversity:
    1.  **Task-aware Routing**: A Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically adjusts the editing granularity (e.g., focusing on a local object or a global style) based on the instruction.
    2.  **Learnable Task Embeddings**: Task-specific embeddings that guide the model to coordinate the complexity of different editing types, preventing confusion and improving accuracy.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
-   **AnyEdit (Presented)**: A new multi-modal, instruction-based editing dataset comprising 2.5 million high-quality editing pairs. It spans 25 distinct editing types across the five domains mentioned above. This dataset was used to train the proposed AnySD model.
-   **AnyEdit-Test (Presented)**: A challenging new benchmark manually curated from the AnyEdit dataset, containing 1,250 high-quality editing pairs (50 per category). It was used to rigorously evaluate the performance of models on complex and diverse editing scenarios not well-covered by existing benchmarks.
-   **MagicBrush & Emu-Edit Test (Used)**: Existing standard benchmarks used for evaluation and to compare the performance of AnySD against other state-of-the-art models.

## 4. Main Results
-   On standard benchmarks like MagicBrush and Emu-Edit, the AnySD model trained on the AnyEdit dataset achieves new state-of-the-art results. On the EMU-Edit Test, AnySD achieves a CLIPim score of 0.872, outperforming prior methods and demonstrating superior semantic alignment and content preservation.
-   On the more challenging, newly proposed **AnyEdit-Test** benchmark, AnySD significantly outperforms all baseline models across all editing categories. This highlights its enhanced robustness and scalability in handling complex, multi-scene, and visual-conditioned edits where other models often fail.
-   The authors conclude that the AnyEdit dataset and the AnySD model present a promising direction for developing unified, instruction-driven image editing models that can effectively support human creativity.

## 5. Ablation Studies
The authors performed several ablation studies to validate the contributions of the key components of their framework, evaluated on the EMU-Edit Test benchmark.

-   **Task-aware Routing**: Removing this MoE component led to a significant performance degradation. The CLIPim score dropped from 0.872 to 0.838, and the L1 error more than doubled (from 0.070 to 0.154), confirming its crucial role in adapting the model to diverse editing tasks.
-   **Task Embeddings**: When the learnable task embeddings were removed, visual consistency was notably affected (L1 error increased from 0.070 to 0.107), indicating their importance in controlling the perceptual granularity of edits.
-   **Counterfactual Data**: Training the model without the counterfactual synthetic data (AnyEdit-Composition) resulted in a decline in semantic performance (CLIPout score dropped by 4.9%), which validates the effectiveness of this data in improving the model's generalization capabilities.
