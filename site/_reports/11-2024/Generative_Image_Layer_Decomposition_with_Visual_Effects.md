![Figure 1. (a) Given an input image and a binary object mask, our model is able to decompose the image into a clean background layer and a transparent foreground layer with preserved visual effects such as shadows and reflections. (b) Subsequently, our decomposition empowers complex and controllable layer-wise editing such as spatial, color and/or style editing.]({{ '/images/11-2024/Generative_Image_Layer_Decomposition_with_Visual_Effects/figure_1.jpg' | relative_url }})
## 1. Motivation of the Paper
The authors address a key limitation in modern generative image editing: the lack of precise control for compositional tasks. While diffusion models excel at various edits, they struggle to decompose images into distinct, independently editable layers. Existing methods often fail to separate a foreground object from its associated visual effects (e.g., shadows, reflections), which prevents realistic and seamless editing, such as moving or resizing an object, as the visual effects are left behind or improperly handled. This paper aims to solve this by creating a system that can decompose an image into a clean background layer and a transparent foreground layer that faithfully preserves these crucial visual effects.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The core idea is **LayerDecomp**, a generative framework that decomposes a masked object in an image into two distinct layers: a photorealistic background and a transparent RGBA foreground containing both the object and its visual effects.

The methodology has three main pillars:
1.  **Hybrid Dataset Pipeline:** To train the model effectively, the authors create a large-scale dataset by combining (1) **simulated data**, where foreground objects with synthesized shadows are programmatically blended onto random backgrounds, providing ground-truth for both layers, and (2) **camera-captured data**, consisting of real-world scenes photographed with and without an object, which helps the model generalize to natural visual effects.
2.  **Diffusion-based Architecture:** The model is built upon a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It takes a composite image and an object mask as conditional inputs and is trained to denoise latent representations of the background and foreground layers.
3.  **Consistency Loss (`Lconsist`):** For real-world data lacking ground-truth foregrounds, this novel loss is introduced. It enforces that the predicted background and foreground layers, when alpha-blended back together, must closely match the original input image in pixel space. This implicitly forces the model to learn to place transparent effects like shadows and reflections into the foreground layer to ensure a consistent reconstruction.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
- **Training Data (Curated by Authors):**
    - **Simulated Dataset:** A large-scale corpus of image triplets (composite, background, foreground) generated by blending object assets with synthesized shadows onto stock images.
    - **Camera-Captured Dataset:** 6,000 pairs of real-world images showing scenes with and without a target object.
- **Evaluation Benchmarks:**
    - **RORD:** A real-world dataset for object removal with human-labeled tight and loose masks.
    - **MULAN:** A synthesized dataset providing multi-layer RGBA decompositions of objects.
    - **DESOBAv2:** A real-world dataset with shadow annotations, used to evaluate shadow removal performance.
    - **Emu-Edit Remove Set:** A dataset used for user studies comparing against instruction-driven object removal methods.

## 4. Main Results
- **Object Removal:** LayerDecomp significantly outperforms state-of-the-art mask-based inpainting methods. On the RORD benchmark, it achieves a PSNR of 24.79, compared to scores around 21-22 for methods like ControlNet Inpainting and SD-XL Inpainting.
- **Spatial Editing:** In user studies comparing object moving and resizing, LayerDecomp was overwhelmingly preferred over competitors. For example, against `DesignEdit` on resizing tasks, LayerDecomp was preferred for its overall quality in over 87% of cases, primarily because it correctly moves shadows and reflections along with the object.
- **Author-claimed Impact:** By decomposing images into a photorealistic background and a transparent foreground with preserved visual effects, the model unlocks precise and creative layer-wise editing possibilities, bridging a critical gap in existing editing workflows.

## 5. Ablation Studies
The authors conducted a thorough ablation study on a held-out set of 635 camera-captured images to validate each component of their framework.
1.  **Adding an RGBA Foreground Layer:** Compared to a baseline that only inpaints the background (RGB-only), adding a separate RGBA foreground prediction layer slightly improved background quality and enabled decomposition.
2.  **Training with Visual Effects:** Incorporating simulated data with synthesized visual effects into the training process further improved the quality of both the background and the re-composited image (PSNR on re-composited image increased from 27.53 to 28.66).
3.  **Adding Consistency Loss (`Lconsist`):** Introducing the consistency loss provided the most substantial performance gain. It improved the re-composited image PSNR from 28.66 to 30.53 and reduced the FID score from 16.87 to 12.75. This confirms that the loss is highly effective at teaching the model to produce accurate foreground representations, especially for complex visual effects, without direct supervision.

![Figure 2. The framework of L AYER D ECOMP . The model takes four inputs: two conditional inputs, including a composite image and an object mask, and two noisy latent representations of the background and foreground layers. During training, we use simulated image triplets alongside camera-captured background-composite image pairs. We also introduce a pixel-space consistency loss to ensure that natural visual effects such as shadows and refelctions are faithfully preserved in the transparent foreground layer.]({{ '/images/11-2024/Generative_Image_Layer_Decomposition_with_Visual_Effects/figure_2.jpg' | relative_url }})
![Figure 3. Object removal comparison with mask-based methods. Our model, using tight input masks, generates more visually plausible results with fewer artifacts compared to ControlNet Inpainting [ 50 ], SD-XL Inpainting [ 33 ], and PowerPaint [ 55 ], which all require loose mask input. Besides, our model delivers coherent foreground layers and supports more advanced downstream editing tasks.]({{ '/images/11-2024/Generative_Image_Layer_Decomposition_with_Visual_Effects/figure_3.jpg' | relative_url }})

Combining with a text-based grounding method, our model can effectively remove target objects and preserve background integrity, while existing instruction-based editing methods, such as EmuEdit [ 36 ], MGIE [ 9 ], and OmniGen [ 44 ], may struggle to fully remove the target or maintain background consistency.]({{ '/images/11-2024/Generative_Image_Layer_Decomposition_with_Visual_Effects/figure_5.jpg' | relative_url }})
