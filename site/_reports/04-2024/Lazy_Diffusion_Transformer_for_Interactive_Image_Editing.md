## 1. Motivation of the Paper
Current diffusion-based inpainting methods, while powerful, are ill-suited for interactive applications due to high latency. They are computationally wasteful because they regenerate the entire image for every edit, even when only a small region is being modified. Alternative approaches that process a tight crop around the masked area are faster but sacrifice global image context, often leading to semantically inconsistent or low-quality results. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating a method that is both fast enough for interactive use and capable of producing globally coherent, high-quality edits.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The paper introduces **LazyDiffusion**, a novel transformer-based architecture designed for efficient, localized image updates. The core idea is to decouple context encoding from image generation.

*   **Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** The model consists of two main components: a context encoder and a diffusion decoder.
*   **Global Context Encoder:** A Vision Transformer (ViT) processes the entire visible canvas and user mask *once* per edit. Its key innovation is an information bottleneck: after processing, it discards all output tokens corresponding to the visible (unmasked) regions. It retains only the tokens from the masked area, which now serve as a compact but rich summary of the global context relevant to the region being generated.
*   **"Lazy" Diffusion Decoder:** A second transformer, the diffusion decoder, operates iteratively like a standard diffusion model. However, it only processes tokens corresponding to the masked region. At each denoising step, it takes the noisy masked tokens and conditions them on the compact global context from the encoder and the user's text prompt.
*   **Efficiency:** Because the iterative and computationally heavy diffusion process operates only on the masked pixels, the model's runtime scales with the size of the mask, not the entire image. This "lazy" generation makes it significantly faster for typical small-to-medium sized edits.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
*   **Training Dataset:** The primary model was trained on an internal dataset of **220 million high-quality 1024x1024 images** with diverse scenes and objects. Masks and text prompts were generated automatically using an entity segmentation model and the BLIP-2 captioning model to simulate real-world use cases.
*   **Evaluation Dataset:** Quantitative metrics were reported on a random sample of **10,000 images** from the **OpenImages** dataset.
*   **Ablation Study Dataset:** Architectural ablation studies were performed using the **ImageNet** dataset at 256x256 resolution for unconditional inpainting, which allowed for faster experimentation.

## 4. Main Results
LazyDiffusion successfully balances speed and quality, making it suitable for interactive editing.

*   **Performance Speedup:** The method achieves a **10x speedup** over standard full-image regeneration methods for typical edits where the mask covers 10% of the image. It is also faster than crop-based methods for masks covering up to 25% of the image area.
*   **Generation Quality:**
    *   Quantitatively, LazyDiffusion achieves a FID score of 7.70, which is only marginally worse than a full-regeneration baseline (7.38) but significantly better than a crop-based baseline (9.35).
    *   A user study showed that results from LazyDiffusion are strongly preferred over crop-based methods (in ~82% of cases) and are competitive with full-image regeneration methods (preferred in ~47% of cases), demonstrating that its compressed context is highly effective at maintaining global semantic consistency.

## 5. Ablation Studies
The authors performed extensive ablation studies to validate their core architectural choices: (1) using a compressed context (by dropping tokens) and (2) the mechanism for conditioning the decoder on this context.

*   **Compressed vs. Full Context:** Models using the compressed context (only tokens from the masked region) were compared against models that used the full context from the entire image. The study found that the compressed context models achieved better quality (lower FID). The authors speculate that the information bottleneck forces the encoder to create a more expressive and selective context, simplifying the decoder's task.
*   **Conditioning Mechanism:** Several methods for feeding the context into the decoder were tested, including cross-attention, sequence-length concatenation, and a weighted sum. The chosen method, concatenating the context and noise tokens along their hidden dimension, proved to be the most effective. This direct, one-to-one conditioning of each generated token on its corresponding context token yielded the best performance.

![Figure 2. Comparing inpainting approaches. (a) Most works [ 37 , 42 ] generate the entire image, utilizing the full image context and fill the hole by discarding the non-masked regions. While the outcome aligns well with the image, the process is timeconsuming. (b) generating only a lower resolution crop around the mask is more efficient and still seamlessly blends with nearby pixels [ 50 , 54 ]. However, the inpainted content is semantically inconsistent with the overall image context. (c) our approach ensures both global consistency and efficient execution.]({{ '/images/04-2024/Lazy_Diffusion_Transformer_for_Interactive_Image_Editing/figure_2.jpg' | relative_url }})
![Figure 3. Our diffusion transformer decoder (bottom) reduces synthesis computation using two strategies. First, we compress the image context using a separate encoder (not shown) outside the diffusion loop. Second, we only generate tokens corresponding to the masked region to generate. In contrast, typical diffusion transformers (top) [ 7 , 35 ] maintain tokens for the entire image throughout the diffusion process, to preserve global context. When performing inpainting, such model generates a full-size image, most of which is discarded in order to in-fill the hole region only. Existing convolutional diffusion models for inpainting [ 42 ] suffer from the same drawbacks.]({{ '/images/04-2024/Lazy_Diffusion_Transformer_for_Interactive_Image_Editing/figure_3.jpg' | relative_url }})
![Figure 4. Overview. To generate an incremental image update, our algorithm takes as input a user mask and a text prompt. (top) We start by transforming the visible pixels and binary mask into patches, and pass them to a vision transformer (ViT) encoder. We then drop all tokens, except those corresponding to the hole region; this is our global context. (bottom) To generate the missing pixels, we initialize a set of noise patches corresponding to the masked region and pass them through a diffusion transformer model for several denoising iterations, until we obtain denoised patches. Unlike previous works [ 7 , 35 ], which process the entire image, our diffusion transformer only processes the patches required to cover the missing region. We train our encoder and diffusion decoder jointly using a diffusion denoising objective on the missing patches. The generated patches are then blended back into the missing region to produce the final output. Our model operates in a pretrained latent image space [ 42 ], but we illustrate our pipeline with RGB images for simplicity.]({{ '/images/04-2024/Lazy_Diffusion_Transformer_for_Interactive_Image_Editing/figure_4.jpg' | relative_url }})

![Figure 7. Comparing Inpainting Results: (Top) Inpainting most objects requires relatively little semantic context. In such cases, all methods produce reasonably good results, even those processing only a tight crop. (Bottom) However, when inpainting an object closely related to others, such as one bun out of many, the inpainting model requires robust semantic understanding. Methods processing only a crop produce objects that may seem reasonable in isolation, but do not fit well within the greater context of the image. In contrast, LazyDiffusion adeptly leverages the compressed image context to generate high-fidelity results, comparable in quality to models regenerating the entire image and running up to ten times slower. Additional results are provided in Figs. 11 to 14 .]({{ '/images/04-2024/Lazy_Diffusion_Transformer_for_Interactive_Image_Editing/figure_7.jpg' | relative_url }})
