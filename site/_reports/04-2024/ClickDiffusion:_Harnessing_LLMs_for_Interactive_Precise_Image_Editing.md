![Figure 1. C LICK D IFFUSION is an interactive system that enables users to perform fine-grained image manipulation tasks by seamlessly combining natural language and visual prompts. (A) In our example, a user can use our user interface to select a particular dog with a bounding box and a destination using a star. These locations can be referenced symbolically in a natural language instruction. (B) By serializing the original imageâ€™s layout and the multi-modal instruction we can leverage an LLM to produce an edited image layout. (C) The edited layout is then fed into a layout-based image generation system to generate an edited image. (D) Our method enables moving objects and allows for much more concise prompts than text-only editing systems like I NSTRUCT P IX 2P IX [ 3 ].]({{ '/images/04-2024/ClickDiffusion:_Harnessing_LLMs_for_Interactive_Precise_Image_Editing/figure_1.jpg' | relative_url }})
## 1. Motivation of the Paper
Existing image editing methods that rely solely on natural language instructions struggle with precision. It is difficult for users to unambiguously specify *which* object to edit when multiple similar objects are present, or to define a precise target location using only words. Conversely, traditional direct manipulation interfaces (e.g., drawing tools) offer spatial precision but lack the descriptive flexibility of language for complex semantic changes (e.g., "make it a husky"). The paper addresses this gap by proposing a system that synergistically combines the spatial precision of visual prompts with the descriptive power of natural language instructions.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The core hypothesis is that a multi-modal image editing task can be reframed as a text-to-text generation problem solvable by a Large Language Model (LLM). The methodology consists of three main stages:
1.  **Multi-modal Input:** A user interacts with an interface to provide instructions. They can draw bounding boxes to select objects and place markers (stars) to indicate destinations. These visual cues are symbolically linked within a natural language command (e.g., "Move [box1] to [star1] and make it a husky").
2.  **LLM-based Layout Transformation:** The system serializes the initial image's object layout (objects and their bounding boxes) and the user's multi-modal instruction into a single text prompt. This prompt is fed to an LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), which, guided by few-shot examples via in-context learning, generates a new, edited text layout. Chain-of-thought prompting is used to improve the LLM's reasoning.
3.  **Image Generation:** The final, edited text layout is passed to a layout-conditioned diffusion model (GLIGEN) to render the final output image.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
The system does not require large-scale training or fine-tuning. Instead, it relies on the in-context learning ability of a pre-trained LLM. To enable this, the authors created a small, hand-annotated set of approximately 20 examples. Each example consists of an input layout, a multi-modal instruction, a chain-of-thought reasoning sequence, and the corresponding correct output layout. These examples are placed in the LLM's context window at inference time to guide it on new, unseen tasks.

## 4. Main Results
The evaluation is qualitative, comparing ClickDiffusion against text-only baselines: InstructPix2Pix and LLM Grounded Diffusion (LGD).
- In a task requiring moving a specific red ball among several, ClickDiffusion successfully moved the correct ball and changed its color as instructed. In contrast, InstructPix2Pix failed to move the object, and LGD moved it to an incorrect location.
- In another task, ClickDiffusion enabled a user to move two selected apples with a very concise command. LGD could perform the edit but required a much more complex and tedious text prompt to disambiguate the objects and describe the action.
- The authors claim that ClickDiffusion enables more precise and complex image manipulations with significantly more intuitive and concise user input compared to text-only approaches.

## 5. Ablation Studies
Not performed. The paper's evaluation section focuses on a comparative analysis against existing systems rather than performing ablation studies on the components of the ClickDiffusion framework.

![Figure 2. C LICK D IFFUSION enables users to perform precise image manipulations that are difficult to do with text alone. A user can leverage familiar direct manipulation to specify regions or objects in an image, which can be referred to in text instructions. By combining direct manipulation and natural language based editing it becomes much easier for users to perform precise edits like: moving a particular object, adding an object in a specified location, or changing the appearance of an object.]({{ '/images/04-2024/ClickDiffusion:_Harnessing_LLMs_for_Interactive_Precise_Image_Editing/figure_2.jpg' | relative_url }})
![Figure 3. Our approach enables a user to disambiguate a particular object from other similar objects, move it, and change its appearance. In contrast, text-only editing approaches like I NSTRUCT P IX 2P IX [ 3 ] and LLM G ROUNDED D IFFUSION [ 13 ] fail to localize the manipulation to the correct object, despite requiring a much longer and more difficult to write edit instruction.]({{ '/images/04-2024/ClickDiffusion:_Harnessing_LLMs_for_Interactive_Precise_Image_Editing/figure_3.jpg' | relative_url }})
