![Figure 1. We propose DiffEditor , which can perform various fine-grained image editing operations on general images. Given an image, users can select an object to move or resize, or they can select sevaral pixel points for more accurate content dragging. Moreover, users can also choose a reference image for cross-image editing, i.e. , object pasting and appearance replacing.]({{ '/images/02-2024/DiffEditor:_Boosting_Accuracy_and_Flexibility_on_Diffusion-based_Image_Editing/figure_1.jpg' | relative_url }})
## 1. Motivation of the Paper
Existing diffusion-based image editing methods often struggle with two key issues. First, in complex editing scenarios, they can lack accuracy and produce unexpected artifacts. Second, they often lack the flexibility to harmonize edits by imagining new content that is not present in the source image (e.g., generating teeth when opening a closed mouth). This paper, DiffEditor, aims to address these weaknesses to improve both the accuracy and creative flexibility of fine-grained image editing.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The core of DiffEditor is to enhance a diffusion-based editing framework by introducing several cooperative components. The methodology is built upon the Stable Diffusion model and does not require task-specific tuning.
-   **Image Prompts:** To provide a more detailed content description than text prompts alone, the authors introduce an image prompt encoder. This helps guide the diffusion process with richer visual information from the source image, reducing distortion and improving generation quality.
-   **Regional SDE Sampling:** To increase editing flexibility without sacrificing overall consistency, the method locally injects randomness using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) only within the user-defined editing region. The background remains unedited via a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) process.
-   **Regional Gradient Guidance:** To prevent editing operations from affecting unrelated parts of the image, the guidance gradients for editing and content consistency are applied only to their respective masked regions. This minimizes interference and preserves background content.
-   **Time Travel:** For complex edits, the model incorporates a recurrent guidance strategy. It performs rollbacks within the diffusion sampling process (i.e., `zt ‚Üê zt-1`) to refine the latent representation at a specific step, which helps inhibit disharmonious results.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
-   **LAION:** A large-scale image-text dataset used to train the image prompt encoder module.
-   **CelebA-HQ:** A dataset of high-quality celebrity faces. A test set of 800 aligned faces was used to evaluate performance on the content dragging (face manipulation) task.

## 4. Main Results
DiffEditor demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various fine-grained editing tasks.
-   **Content Dragging (Face Manipulation):** On the CelebA-HQ dataset, DiffEditor achieves superior accuracy and image quality compared to other diffusion-based methods like DragonDiff. For 68-point manipulation, it reduced the Mean Squared Error (MSE) from 13.94 (DragonDiff) to 11.52 and improved the FID score from 34.58 to 33.02.
-   **General Editing Tasks:** In qualitative comparisons for object moving, pasting, and appearance replacing, DiffEditor produces results with better content consistency, object identity, and richer texture details than competing methods like Self-Guidance and DragonDiff.

## 5. Ablation Studies
The authors performed ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of their key components:
-   **Image Prompt:** Removing the image prompt resulted in noticeable distortions during image reconstruction (DDIM inversion) and led to a higher probability of artifacts during editing, demonstrating its role in providing a stable generation prior.
-   **Regional Gradient Guidance:** Without regional constraints, the editing gradient was shown to "leak" into unedited areas, causing unwanted changes (e.g., distorting fingers in the background). Applying the regional mask successfully preserved content consistency in these areas.
-   **Time Travel:** In complex editing scenarios, disabling the time travel strategy led to distorted and lower-quality results. The proposed "accurate" time travel method was shown to significantly improve editing quality compared to both no time travel and a naive random-noise time travel approach.
