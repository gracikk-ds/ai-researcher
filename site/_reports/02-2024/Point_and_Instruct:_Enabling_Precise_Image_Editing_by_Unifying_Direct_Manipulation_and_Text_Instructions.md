![Figure 1: Point & Instruct empowers users to specify image editing instructions that combine the expressively of natural language and the spatial precision of direct manipulation. We show an example of our method, which allows a user to move a particular dog to a precise location and change its appearance. (Left) A user can select which object in particular they wish to manipulate with a bounding box, and specify a location to move the object to with a star. These geometric shapes can be referenced in a natural language instruction symbolically and combined with language only instructions that specify changes to the appearance of objects. (Right) For comparison we show how the popular text-based editing system InstructPix2Pix [ 3 ] fails at this task. Not only does this system require a much more verbose query to convey the same image edit, but it also fails to move objects and fails to localize changes to the correct objects.]({{ '/images/02-2024/Point_and_Instruct:_Enabling_Precise_Image_Editing_by_Unifying_Direct_Manipulation_and_Text_Instructions/figure_1.jpg' | relative_url }})
## 1. Motivation of the Paper
Existing text-based image editing systems struggle with precise, fine-grained manipulations. It is difficult for users to specify exactly *which* object to edit in a crowded scene (e.g., one specific dog among several) or *where* to move it using text alone. This often requires complex, verbose prompts that frequently fail to produce the desired result. Conversely, direct manipulation (e.g., clicking and dragging) offers excellent spatial precision but lacks the descriptive power of natural language to specify complex appearance changes (e.g., "make the dog a white husky"). The authors address this gap by creating a system that combines the spatial precision of direct manipulation with the descriptive expressiveness of natural language.

## 2. Key Ideas and Methodology
The paper introduces **POINT & INSTRUCT**, a system that unifies direct manipulation and text instructions for precise image editing. The core idea is to reframe the multimodal editing task as a text-to-text generation problem solvable by a Large Language Model (LLM).

The methodology consists of three main stages:
1.  **Multimodal Input:** Users interact with an image on a canvas, using geometric shapes like bounding boxes to select objects and stars to specify locations. These visual markers are symbolically inserted into a natural language instruction (e.g., "Move [box] to [star] and make it an apple").
2.  **LLM-based Layout Transformation:** The system serializes the initial image's object layout (bounding boxes and labels) and the user's multimodal instruction into a single text prompt. An LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo), guided by a few hand-annotated examples via in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting, processes this input to generate a new, transformed textual layout that reflects the requested edit.
3.  **Layout-to-Image Generation:** The final edited image is rendered from the transformed textual layout using a layout-conditioned diffusion model like GLIGEN.

This approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to interpret complex instructions without needing to fine-tune the model.

## 3. Datasets Used / Presented
The system does not rely on a large-scale training dataset. Instead, it uses:
*   **Custom In-Context Examples:** A small set of approximately 15-20 hand-annotated examples were created by the authors. Each example includes a serialized input layout, a multimodal instruction, a chain-of-thought reasoning process, and the corresponding output layout. These are used to guide the LLM at inference time.
*   **DiffusionDB:** For planned user studies, the authors mention using images generated from prompts in the DiffusionDB dataset to create the initial images for editing tasks.

## 4. Main Results
The results are presented qualitatively through direct comparisons with existing text-only editing methods, namely InstructPix2Pix and LLM Grounded Diffusion.
*   In tasks requiring disambiguation and precise location/attribute changes (e.g., moving one specific red ball among many and making it black), POINT & INSTRUCT successfully executes the edit with a simple, concise instruction.
*   In contrast, InstructPix2Pix failed to move the correct object or localize the attribute change, while LLM Grounded Diffusion either moved the object to an incorrect location or required a significantly more complex and tedious text prompt to achieve a similar result.
*   The author-claimed impact is a novel and effective framework that enables users to perform precise image manipulations that are difficult or impossible with text-only systems, by synergistically combining direct manipulation and natural language.

## 5. Ablation Studies
Not performed. The paper presents comparative analyses against other state-of-the-art systems but does not include ablation studies where components of its own framework are systematically removed or replaced.

![Figure 2: Point & Instruct enables users to perform precise image manipulations that are difficult to do with text alone. A user can leverage familiar direct manipulation to specify regions or objects in an image, which can be referred to in text instructions. By combining direct manipulation and natural language based editing it becomes much easier for users to perform precise edits like: moving a particular object, adding an object in a specified location, or changing the appearance of an object.]({{ '/images/02-2024/Point_and_Instruct:_Enabling_Precise_Image_Editing_by_Unifying_Direct_Manipulation_and_Text_Instructions/figure_2.jpg' | relative_url }})
![Figure 3: Point & Instruct harnesses the power of LLMs to process a variety of instructions and leverages visual information specified by simple geometric objects. The flexibility of text prompts can be seamlessly combined with familiar GUI elements, making it simple to understand and use. In our example use-case, a user would (A) upload an existing image or write a text prompt to generate an image, (B) select object(s) with a bounding box specified through direct manipulation, (C) specify another location to move an object to with a bounding box or star, (D) click enter or a button to run the generation process, and finally (E) view the generated image.]({{ '/images/02-2024/Point_and_Instruct:_Enabling_Precise_Image_Editing_by_Unifying_Direct_Manipulation_and_Text_Instructions/figure_3.jpg' | relative_url }})
![Figure 4: Point & Instruct casts the problem of image editing as a natural language generation task. (A) The input image and instruction are serialized into a textual form, and (B) an LLM accepts the input layout and instruction and produces a transformed layout. Finally, (C) a layout-to-image generation system is used to generate an edited image from the transformed layout.]({{ '/images/02-2024/Point_and_Instruct:_Enabling_Precise_Image_Editing_by_Unifying_Direct_Manipulation_and_Text_Instructions/figure_4.jpg' | relative_url }})
![Figure 5: We leverage in-context learning to take advantage of the few-shot generalization capabilities of LLMs. We place a relatively small number ( â‰ˆ 15 ) examples for our task in the context of an LLM. Each example contains (a) a serialized image layout, (b) a serialized instruction, (c) a chain of thought composed of multiple task-relevant questions meant to assist the LLM by providing it with additional context, and (d) an annotated layout specifying the relevant transformation. At inference time we place an input image layout and instruction after the in-context examples.]({{ '/images/02-2024/Point_and_Instruct:_Enabling_Precise_Image_Editing_by_Unifying_Direct_Manipulation_and_Text_Instructions/figure_5.jpg' | relative_url }})
